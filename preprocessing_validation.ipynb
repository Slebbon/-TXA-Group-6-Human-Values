So, those who run the newspapers and magazines will be extra careful while publishing the news or articles. Hence, print media is more trustworthy than digital media.\n",
      "It is not eco-friendly, since print media requires paper that is harvested from trees.\n",
      "Print media is just one-way communication. It gives information to the public, but consumers cannot share their opinions. Even though some newspapers publish readers’ mails, it is not user-friendly.\n",
      "Print media cannot target a specific audience, whereas digital media can show different ads to a different type of audience and thereby can generate more revenue.\n",
      "Several online news websites are bringing their print versions to reach more consumers and establish credibility.\n",
      "Print media is not helpful for some people with disabilities, whereas digital media has accessibility options in general. For example, digital media helps people with visual impairment by providing audio versions of the content.\n",

      "Bifurcation can result in better governance and more efficient administration. It can also help in tackling terrorism.\n",
      "This may set as a bad example for the succeeding governments. Downgrading the status of a state to union territory can be taken as a precedent. For example, If the state government is ruled by a different party from the center, and if the center wants to take control of the state, this incident can be shown as an example to do so.\n",
      "This step may be used by separatists to influence youngsters in acting against the Indian government.\n",
      "Moreover, tourism and film shootings faced obstacles due to the militancy in J&K. Now as Ladakh is a separate union territory, it can boost its economy.\n",
      "Bifurcation of Jammu & Kashmir was done without consulting the people and local leaders of the state. Moreover, there was a blackout of communication channels and media, so they had no possibility of expressing their views. This sends a wrong message to the people and is against the democratic principles of India. It is also against the federal principles, which guarantees rights to states. Moreover, on the same day, Article 370 was revoked, so this may make local people feel like they have no say in the decisions that impact them.\n",
      "Further division of Ladakh into 2 districts – Leh and Kargil on a religious basis is facing criticism from the local people. This move could have been avoided to preserve unity.\n",
      "When Jammu&Kashmir were one state, Ladakh felt alienated. Its ecological and cultural uniqueness was not given enough importance and was often neglected because the culture of Ladakh and J&K are very different. Thereby people of Ladakh are demanding bifurcation for a long time. Ladakh’s local leaders feel that their region was politically neglected by the administration at J&K. So, bifurcating is a good decision.\n",
      "We were champions of hockey even when we were not independent. We have won Olympic 8 gold medals in Hockey, the highest in any sport. We had a glorious past, and we should work towards restoring it. Making cricket a national game may overshadow hockey.\n",
      "Apart from the raw passion, the money and fame that follows are blinding. Unlike other players of other sports, the cricketers even at the junior levels earn handsomely, which is also a motivating factor that this game ensures financial security provided you play well.\n",
      "India has been performing outstandingly well in cricket for the past 20 years or so. It is the most popular sport in India. Children are madly passionate about it, people are deeply involved in the game, and there is a cricket critic in every Indian house. The BCCI has been successful in brilliantly marketing and encouraging the game as well. BCCI is the richest cricket board in the world and the richest sports controlling authority in India. No sports authority has managed their game so well in India as compared to BCCI. We have won 3 World Cups, 2 Champion Trophies, and many more prestigious tournaments.\n",
      "Cricket basically originated in England and gained popularity in colonial countries as the English masters used to play. The fine Englishmen used to bat all day and the tiring bowling work was done by the locals of the colonies. This game is a sign of the presence of colonialism.\n",
      "Crony capitalists are able to get away with just about anything. They enjoy the full support of money and the government in all their endeavors. Their decisions may even cause the economy to suffer adversely.\n",
      "Crony capitalists get an advantage over their competitors due to support from the government. Simple examples of the undue advantage they get may be in the form of easier loan sanctions, loan approvals despite adverse credit ratings, easier land acquisition, out-of-turn property registration, tender approvals without any past record of performance, etc. This ruins the reward system of the markets. A monopoly gets established in the markets which prevents new players from entering the markets. This leads to lesser entrepreneurial activity in the country. Decreased entrepreneurial activity leads to lesser job opportunities and borrowing.\n",
      "Crony capitalism has led to India having the world’s worst non-performing loan ratio. Lenders gave away loans to unworthy entities over the years despite knowing their credit backgrounds. The current amount of bad debts is approximately equal to INR 9 lakh crore and is expected to increase by INR 2 Trillion next year. The banks are left with no other option but to take huge haircuts (sometimes even as high as 65%) on the loans recovered. Taxpayers' money is often used to bail out these banks in order to save the economy.\n",
      "An atmosphere of decreased lending is created and, in turn, the economy gets slowed down. As can be seen in India, entrepreneurial activity is extremely low. Job opportunities are extremely low today. India is experiencing the highest levels of unemployment in the last 4 decades. The Indian economy has been posting 7%+ GDP repeatedly but yet the common people are suffering while the rich are getting richer.\n",
      "As women face violence because of their gender, they need special laws to protect them. But, in general, men do not face physical harassment just because of their gender.\n",
      "In India, it is very difficult for women to go to police stations to report crimes against them. Men’s commission may further deter them from approaching courts.\n",
      "If a woman is a victim of any sort of harassment and is in a distress, society will more likely to help her. But the same is not true for men. If a man is a victim of domestic violence or sexual harassment, there is no single government entity he can approach to. Moreover, society may make fun of him for being weak. This is the reason married men are twice likely to commit suicide when compared to married women. To address these gender stereotypes and discrimination, there is a need for 'National commission for Men'.\n",
      "As per the 2011 census, India has a 51.47% male population. India has a 'Ministry for women & child development', but none of the government entities is working on men’s rights. As India is a democratic country, it is unfair to neglect people based on their gender.\n",
      "With better and more stringent mechanisms and laws in place to deal with sexual harassment, rape cases, and domestic violence cases, unfortunately, there have been instances of misuse of the laws to cause harm to innocent men. Setting up a Ministry of Men would at least give such men a chance to make their case. This, in no way, is meant to undermine the case for the protection of women.\n",
      "It has been observed that in countries where the sex ratio is skewed against women, crimes against women increase drastically. As can be easily seen in India, crimes against women have been on the rise. Most horrific of all, crimes against minor girls have increased drastically since 2012. This paints a very grim picture of our society as a whole. The highest GDP growth rate amounts to nothing if our society itself is corrupted to the extent that it is right now. India has been a patriarchal society for centuries. To make a shift to an egalitarian society for women in every aspect of life, Indian men need to be re-educated and rehabilitated with the new norms.\n",
      "Drug addiction is a menace that has plagued Indian youth in recent years. The majority of drug addicts are males. A ministry of men can help solve the problem of why capable male youth of the country are resorting to such self-destructive activities.\n",
      "The residents get to have a community of their own. They can interact, make friends and enjoy themselves together.\n",
      "Retirement homes are usually built in such a manner that injuries due to domestic accidents are minimized. Skid-proof tiles, arthritis-friendly fittings, etc are some of the features that they exhibit.\n",
      "The elders get to live a life of dignity. They do not feel like a burden on any of their relatives. They are also treated respectfully in their own community as compared to being ill-treated by their relatives.\n",
      "Medical facilities are readily available at retirement homes making it easier for the elderly in case of severe emergency or even the slightest discomfort.\n",
      "At well-maintained retirement homes, they get individual care for their condition, be it any kind of sickness, disability, or medical condition. Nurses, caretakers, etc make sure that they are comfortable.\n",
      "Any retirement home worth spending the rest of your life in is quite costly for a middle-class family.\n",
      "Senior living homes or retirement homes may sometimes feel secluded from the outer world.\n",
      "The residents may feel a lack of connectivity with their family members. Being away from the family for too long can sometimes be depressing for some people.\n",
      "What caregivers and nurses cannot substitute is the feeling of being loved by your family members. For them, it’s only a job and there is no connection at a personal level.\n",
      "The residents might be ill-treated by the authorities at the retirement homes.\n",
      "Though our constitution guarantees equal rights to women in all aspects, the mentality of people didn’t change. There have been several cases of rapes, domestic violence, dowry, acid attacks, etc. that led to the formation of several strict laws for women's safety. In 2011, India was ranked as the fourth most dangerous country for women in the world (in 2018 India was ranked the most dangerous country for women) and worst among the G20 nations when it comes to women's security.\n",
      "Women are lagging far behind men in education. Fewer girls attend school as compared to boys and also their dropout rate is high. According to the 2011 census, the data literacy rate of women is 65.46% as compared to 82.14% of men. This difference is alarming.\n",
      "Though the government and courts are trying to bring equality to society, it has to be the people’s mindset that needs a change. And in big and developed cities of India, this positive change is quite visible but in villages and small towns, there is a lot of gender inequality to be dealt with.\n",
      "As per Article 370, people of other regions cannot buy land or settle in Jammu & Kashmir. This is acting against the development of the region. By abolishing article 370, teachers, doctors, and other professionals can settle there bringing better facilities. And also industries can be set up in the region and hence Jammu & Kashmir can be economically developed.\n",
      "By abolishing this article, the government can act tough against the terrorism present in the region.\n",
      "Many laws such as The prohibition of the Child Marriage Act, and women’s reservations were not applicable to Jammu & Kashmir, because of the provisions of Article 370. All laws of India should also be applicable to J&K.\n",
      "People of J&K have a feeling that settlers from other regions will change the demography of the region. So, due to the abolition of article 370, they may protest against the central government.\n",
      "Citizens of Jammu & Kashmir are facing so much struggle because of many reasons such as the fight between India and Pakistan, the constant presence of troops, the unemployment crisis, etc. So if the special status is also removed, they may feel like their voice is suppressed.\n",
      "Urbanization results in increased population density, which leads to pressure on resources such as land, water, medical professionals, and police.\n",
      "As more people keep coming to urban areas, there will be more supply of human resources than demand, hence the wages will decrease. Hence many people work so hard for a meager income.\n",
      "More population causes a burden on the government and hence it will be difficult to ensure the quality of life for all.\n",
      "Due to high demand, land prices, housing prices, and rents will increase drastically. Not everyone can afford the prices. Those who can afford to have to spend a large part of their income on housing. The people who cannot afford to rent in urban areas are forced to live in slums with substandard housing and poor sanitation facilities, which negatively affects the health of people living there.\n",
      "Cooked food may get wasted in case of the wrong estimation of hungry people in the area.\n",
      "India ranked 101 out of 116 countries in the Global Hunger Index, 2021. Many people in India are undernourished and are sleeping on an empty stomach. As the supreme court mentioned, it is the duty of the welfare state to ensure that all the citizens have food to eat. By establishing community kitchens throughout the country, we can ensure that everyone has access to nutritious food.\n",
      "Due to the pandemic, many people lost jobs, especially those who are working in the informal sector. So, now community kitchens are more needed than ever.\n",
      "Tonnes of food grains rot every year at the Food Corporation of India (FCI). By supplying the food grains to the community kitchen, the waste of food grains can be prevented, and instead that can be used to feed hungry people. \n",
      "Many people, especially youngsters are willing to volunteer. But not many have access to volunteer options nearby. Once community kitchens are set up, many people will happily volunteer and will donate supplies too.\n",
      "Implementation of community kitchens requires continuous efforts from the government. Many such initiatives from the government are neglected after a few months.\n",
      "Initially, India faced issues such as vaccine shortage, lack of availability of vaccines in remote places, etc. But now after solving all these challenges, the main challenge now is to vaccinate those who do not want to be vaccinated. So, by enforcing legal measures such as compulsory vaccination, we can achieve 100% vaccination. The government can help them in dealing with their fears by keeping them for a longer time in vaccination centers while having a medical team by their side.\n",
      "If the world did not achieve 100% vaccination, a lot of new variants will be created. So, it is important to vaccinate all to reduce the possibility of new strains.\n",
      "Many people are not taking vaccination due to the rumors that are being spread by anti-vaxxers using social media. Taking action against these rumor creators is much better for improving the vaccination rate rather than enforcing compulsory vaccination.\n",
      "Widespread awareness campaigns involving local people can help in overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Innovative and creative advertisements can encourage people to take the vaccination. These methods will be much more effective than legal measures.\n",
      "In the hope of becoming rich, many people are burning money to buy overhyped digital art. Many will lose money when people lose interest in buying these NFTs. Some people are saying that NFTs are a bubble that is going to burst.\n",
      "NFTs help artists sell their paintings, music, etc. for a good amount of money, which may not be possible before NFTs.\n",
      "Whenever an NFT was sold or bought, the transaction consumes lots of electricity. This huge energy consumption is a serious issue because we are already fighting against climate change.\n",
      "Hackers are stealing NFTs. And they are also stealing cryptocurrencies by sending malicious NFTs. Recently, hackers stole $150k worth of crypto from Twitch co-founder’s Fractal NFT project.\n",
      "Drones are being used in many industries. They go to places where it is difficult for humans to go. For example, they can be used to deliver medicines quickly in hilly regions. Drones can be used to deliver food in times of natural calamities. Not just delivering food, using drones, rescue teams can find people that are stuck and can save them. So, drones can save lives.\n",
      "Drones can be misused to stalk, vandalize homes, and for doing many other anti-social activities. There have been many incidents, where drones posed security threats.\n",
      "Earlier, there was a threat of coercion and booth capturing. Some people used to threaten voters to vote for a particular candidate. Using CCTV cameras prevented this to a large extent. But now, e-voting has the same vulnerability. It is difficult to provide security to everyone in their homes.\n",
      "It is prone to hacking. Even when we are using advanced technologies to make it more secure, hackers are also using new technologies and new methods to hack. It may also raise privacy issues. Even though blockchain guarantees anonymity, there is a possibility of a hack to know who voted for whom. Hackers may even hack smartphones to know the details.\n",
      "Still, the digital divide exists in not just India but in the entire world. So, this may create new inequalities where some people can cast their vote from home and some others have to visit a polling station.\n",
      "Children are made to work in industries with hazardous chemicals, and machines under harsh weather conditions, resulting in physical casualties and many severe diseases. \n",
      "Due to a lack of education and proper guidance, they get influenced by criminals and take shortcuts to become rich, and end up committing crimes at a tender age. The rates of juvenile crime cases are increasing day by day in India.\n",
      "The number of harassment and child abuse cases has drastically increased in the last few years most of them are sexual abuse cases occurring with girls and boys aged below 15.\n",
      "Childhood is the most important phase for the development of physical and emotional abilities. The problem of child labor is stealing childhood from many children. Mere making laws to prevent it doesn’t solve the problem. Implementation of the laws on a war footing is needed.\n",
      "There are other options available like ‘Hyperloop’, which is more feasible and less costly. India could have provided her scientific expertise and given land holding to the research and development of these technologies.\n",
      "The cost of the project is more than 1.5 lakh crore for a single rail line. Instead, this money can be invested in the development of the present railway system which is a case deserving more immediate attention, seeing the recent rail accidents in India. \n",
      "Bullet trains will decrease travel time hence increasing connectivity as well as ease the means of transport, hence eliminating regional differences. Moreover, bullet trains could prove to be an important means of transportation for long-duration journeys for the middle-class population of the country.\n",
      "The question of economic feasibility is being raised as the project is too costly at Rs. 1.5 lakh crores. However, similar questions were raised during the introduction of telecom services and the commission of Maruti. As the service expanded and the demand increased, not only did the respective areas become profitable, but the prices also went down outrageously.\n",

This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.\n",

      "In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport. \n",

      "Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there.

      "We have the option to cure hunger in many places, increase the nutritional value of food, increase yields of manufacturing crops like cotton, and make plants resistant to emerging dangers of climatic change and globalization like predatory fungi or insects that harm crops or by making crops resistant to drought and heat waves. It’s sad to see that it has the rest of the world is moving forward, we in Europe have been misled behind in this respect.\n",
      "I am for the ban on internships that do not provide additional education and skills building, which are low-level jobs with no growth prospects. Such internships should be paid definitely. But I am against the ban on unpaid internships which provide other benefits - continuing education, mentoring, experience, skills building, upon which the highly paid job can be acquired in the future. High-quality unpaid internships have an impact on inequality - currently, they put poor people at disadvantage, and hence they are a factor in sustaining the poverty trap.\n",
      "No, just no. You have no right to demand that people put their entire medical history on a card readable by all countries. I would not put mine willingly.  Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off. You do know there are medical data centers and archives for this stuff? Hospitals can access this. But this is on a whole other level and should not be via card and not like this.\n",
      "How would you know how many cases where companies and employees rely on their cars? How would you differentiate between needs and luxury?\n",
      "I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease. So, it should be laudable that businesses are doing this. \n",
      "Instead of GMOs, we could refocus on plant breeding - less risky than GMOs and less harmful to nature.  Also, I consider the statement: 'Humanity has been consuming genetically modified food for thousands of years.' misleading on purpose.  Genetically modified e.g. 500 years ago by whom? The soft way how to sell GMOs, which were created only in the few last decades (as far as it is known).\n",
      "I am not completely against the use of GMOs in general, however, I am against the use of GMOs in the way they have been used until now. Proprietary patented seeds, leading to the increased power of the aggro lobby (and control of the whole food system); Seeds that cannot be reproduced by the farmer himself (posing health risks if done so); Seeds degrading soil and harming the environment due increased (intended) use of herbicides; Often oversold yield benefits, which might actually be lower compared to crops grown with agroecological principles. If we can make GMO seeds that will lead to decreased environmental impact (which is often the opposite of what is often happening now), seeds that will not put smaller farmers at disadvantage (e.g. forcing them to buy new seeds every year), then sure. But not right now.\n",
