no, do, they, have, a, mature, enough, background, to, make, a, sound, decision, towards, this, procedure, targeted, killing, should, not, be, banned, because, it, means, that, dangerous, people, can, be, stopped, from, injuring, other, people, the, two, party, system, is, cheaper, and, easier, to, operate, that, any, multi, party, system, we, should, adopt, atheism, because, it, would, be, easier,

higher, taxes, to, pay, for, the, government, 's, inefficiency, there, is, so, much, more, to, explore, and, learn, about, space, that, subsidising, space, exploration, would, bring, us, closer, to, learning, and, understanding, what, is, beyond, our, planet, we, should, not, subsidize, journalism, because, there, is, already, sufficient, coverage, of, major, issues, from, different, viewpoints, without, government, action, we, should, not, ban, telemarketing, as, it, it, allows, people, to, learn, about, new, products, or, services, from, the, comfort, of, their, own, homes, we, should, not, abolish, capital, punishment, because, if, the, criminal, done, with, their, time, in, jail, they, may, commit, far, more, serious, crime, again, because, some, criminal, can, not, be, rehabilitated, algorithmic, trading, should, be, banned, because, it, gives, some, people, an, unfair, advantage, legalising, prostitution, will, ensure, the, safety, of, both, the, sex, trade, worker, and, client, telemarketing, is, intrusive, annoying, and, violates, privacy, we, should, end, mandatory, retirement, because, it, removes, people, who, are, knowledgeable, and, skilled, from, jobs, that, they, are, good, at, if, you, are, not, required, to, wear, a, uniform, you, are, free, to, choose, clothing, styles, that, are, more, favorable, to, your, body, type, and, coloring, which, allows, you, to,

and, must, conform, to, societies, way, of, thinking, nuclear, weapons, can, bring, about, a, certain, level, of, respect, scientology, is, actually, a, wealthy, cult, and, members, are, abused, physically, and, financially, child, actors, lose, the, sense, of, a, proper, childhood, we, need, the, three, strikes, as, a, deterrent, a, non, denominational, school, prayer, is, about, as, bad, as, reciting, the, pledge, of, allegiance, in, school, and, should, be, allowed, children, need, to, learn, boundaries, and, consequences, for, their, actions, they, learn, faster, if, there, is, immediate, repercussions, than, if, you, let, them, do, it, over, and, over, again, we, should, not, limit, executive, compensation, as, they, should, get, the, salary, equal, to, their, contribution, to, the, organisation, it, will, decrease, the, number, of, crimes, and, violence, on, the, streets, economic, sanctions, are, often, a, proportional, punishment, autonomous, cars, are, prohibitively, expensive, school, uniforms, cost, a, lot, and, might, not, be, affordable, for, everyone, mandatory, retirement, lets, companies, more, easily, make, space, for, new, workers, that, have, more, of, an, incentive, to, work, hard, at, a, new, job, a, zero, tolerance, policy, at, school, is, a, good, idea, because, children, need, to, be, disciplined, as, it, might, cut, crime, in, the, future, safe, spaces, stifle, dialogue, about, controversial, topics, such, as, race, gender, and, religion, economic, sanctions, are, unethical, to, the, economies, of, smaller, underdeveloped, countries, we, should, ban, the, use, of, child, actors, since, it, puts, so, much, pressure, on, them, they, should, be, growing, up, with, a, stable, life, and, just, enjoy, being, a, kid, we, should, subsidize, student, loans, as, these, are, our, future, leaders, and, workers, and, we, want, to, ensure, their, success, in, order, to, secure, the, countries, success, prostitution, should, be, legal, as, it, can, be, controlled, monitored, easier, be, less, dangerous, pride, marches, are, a, crucial, part, of, gay, visibility, and, the, fight, for, equality, ensuring, that, the, fight, against, injustice, continues, especially, in, countries, where, homosexuality, is, still, a, criminal, offense, pride, parades, allow, people, to, make, connections, and, widen, their, social, circles, people, should, keep, their, religion, to, themselves, not, everybody, believes, in, or, practices, a, religion, so, we, should, adopt, atheism, for, them, economic, sanctions, are, used, to, bully, other, nations, to, act, in, your, own, interest, by, harming, the, innocent, citizens, no, less, only, governments, can, be, trusted, with, armies, so, we, should, ban, private, military, companies, it, sets, a, bad, example, for, younger, generation, and, takes, them, away, from, the, ethics, of, the, society, there, are, much, more, important, things, to, spend, money, on, space, exploration, is, a, low, priority, and, should, not, be, subsidized, journalism, is, more, important, than, ever, in, an, era, of, fake, news, and, social, media, we, should, abolish, the, olympic, games, because, bring, together, different, nations, with, radically, different, governments, is, dangerous, factory, farming, treats, animals, inhumanely, which, is, wrong, and, immoral, we, need, to, prohibit, school, prayer, as, not, all, people, agree, with, it, and, it, should, not, be, forced, on, anyone, setting, a, mandatory, retirement, age, allows, for, the, younger, generations, to, move, up, the, ladder, and, to, better, support, their, own, families, the, olympic, games, encourage, animosity, between, countries, austerity, only, leads, to, economic, contraction, that, endangers, the, chance, of, reducing, the, debt, there, are, far, more, than, two, genders, today, and, thus, gender, neutral, language, only, makes, sense, safe, places, are, not, needed, people, need, to, adjust, to, the, world, in, which, they, live, in, and, stop, trying, to, always, seek, protection, from, the, things, they, do, n't, like, there, are, too, many, historical, cases, where, innocent, people, have, been, put, to, death, multi, party, systems, offer, voters, more, choices, and, more, representation, we, can, not, abolish, intellectual, property, rights, because, artists, and, scientists, need, to, have, their, ideas, and, innovations, protected, so, that, they, can, earn, a, living, in, their, fields, with, so, much, sexual, freedom, these, days, prostitution, should, now, be, legal, they, can, cause, accidents, if, the, equipment, fails, cannabis, especially, the, skunk, variety, can, be, very, harmful, to, people, and, can, lead, on, to, them, using, harder, drugs, so, therefore, it, should, be, illegal, judicial, activism, relies, too, heavily, upon, personal, opinion, and, leads, to, bias, we, all, have, the, right, to, eat, what, we, want, to, prohibit, a, specific, type, of, food, is, an, abuse, of, power, allowing, students, to, make, their, own, choices, regarding, the, clothes, they, wear, prepares, them, for, the, adult, world, missionaries, are, intrusive, to, other, countries, and, very, invasive, to, the, culture, cosmetic, surgery, exists, for, vanity, purposes, doctors, who, offer, the, service, should, focus, on, treating, people, with, real, illnesses, the, church, of, scientology, is, a, cult, that, is, harming, society, there, is, no, need, to, subsidize, a, site, that, is, n't, necessary, we, should, not, adopt, libertarianism, because, we, need, the, government, to, provide, essential, services, that, are, unprofitable, a, person, 's, education, should, be, the, responsibility, of, themselves, the, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, is, protected, by, our, government, and, should, be, like, that, so, people, can, defend, their, self, cannabis, should, be, legalized, because, it, is, no, worse, than, alchohol, we, should, continue, to, support, pride, parades, because, everyone, has, the, right, to, do, what, they, want, as, long, as, it, does, not, harm, others, we, should, continue, to, support, algorithmic, trading, as, it, gives, orders, a, jump, start, rather, than, waiting, until, the, complete, order, has, been, produced, if, we, end, economic, sanctions, then, it, would, lead, to, a, more, fair, trade, market, school, uniforms, are, a, good, way, to, keep, our, kids, from, looking, too, sexualized, from, what, they, wear, gender, selection, is, essentially, playing, god,

actors, to, shows, the, world, as, it, is, judicial, activism, allows, for, common, sense, to, be, applied, where, necessary, executives, provide, profits, to, shareholders, and, should, be, compensated, accordingly, it, is, against, certain, religious, beliefs, and, can, be, seen, as, immoral, sex, selection, is, the, perfect, solution, to, a, family, that, has, a, history, of, all, one, gender,   , many, families, want, the, perfect, one, and, one, so, it, 's, perfect, for, those, as, well,   , it, 's, a, win, no, matter, how, you, look, we, should, not, ban, the, use, of, child, actors, because, we, would, not, have, the, shows, and, movies, that, are, otherwise, available, non, trustworthy, news, sources, and, fake, news, stories, abound, we, must, subsidize, investigative, journalism, in, order, to, ensure, we, have, reliable, news, sources, that, report, real, facts, we, should, not, ban, cosmetic, surgery, for, minors, because, there, are, legitimate, cases, when, it,

and, he, is, caught, in, gun, fire, this, type, of, killing, of, the, murderer, is, warranted, human, cloning, is, unethical, and, has, repercussions, that, we, do, not, even, know, yet, autonomous,

knowing, that, the, next, crime, he, commits, might, mean, life, imprisonment, algorithmic, trading, is, faster, and, more, accurate, than, human, guesswork, and, so, provides, greater, value, to, shareholders, the, state, can, not, have, exclusivity, in, the, creation, of, weapons, leaving, aside, private, capital, as, a, source, of, technological, innovations, for, our, defense, children, 's, brains, have, not, matured, and, developed, enough, to, make, life, long, choices, with, regards, to, under, going, cosmetic, surgery, legalising, prostitution, could, lead, to, more, serious, crimes, such, as, women, becoming, involved, in, the, drug, trade, or, people, trafficking, judicial, activism, is, an, important, part, of, our, country, with, genders, now, being, more, equal, than, ever, and, gender, neutrality, growing, exponentially, the, old, gendered, language, is, just, a, historic, anachronism, it, is, unfair, to, convict, someone, for, a, third, crime, that, is, n't, dependent, of, the, crime, 's, magnitude, pride, parades, are, a, necessary, step, towards, bringing, awareness, to, the, world, that, all, human, beings, deserve, respect, and, acceptance, safe, spaces, are, essential, to, people, struggling, its, mental, health, problems, and, getting, rid, of, them, would, increase, their, likelihood, of, abusing, drugs, to, cope, having, intellectual, property, rights, is, a, deterrent, for, those, that, would, steal, another, persons, ideas, and, creations, so, we, must, not, abolish, that, we, should, abolish, safe, spaces, because, they, put, public, funding, for, universities, at, risk, due, to, backlash, from, right, wing, legislatures, making, a, child, work, as, an, actor, deprives, them, of, childhood, experiences, and, interactions, collectivism, removes, an, individual, 's, right, to, promote, their, private, interests, and, exercise, autonomy, if, prostitution, was, legal, then, the, people, would, be, able, to, be, better, protected, and, diseases, could, be, controlled, more, private, military, companies, should, be, banned, as, they, are, not, subject, to, military, laws, amulti, party, system, can, lead, to, unstable, coalitions, in, order, to, get, into, power, factory, farming, should, be, banned, as, the, animals, in, these, farms, are, held, in, bad, conditions, judicial, activism, must, be, supported, by, all, means, because, judges,   , knows, law, and, they, acting, inside, the, law, by, judicial, activism, economic, sanctions, make, items, made, in, foreign, countries, and, shipped, here, more, affordable, for, struggling, americans, cloning, humans, can, allow, us, to, advance, science, and, medicine, in, ways, which, could, save, millions, of, lives, by, producing, organs, stem, cells, etc, for, those, in,

they, choose, to, believe, in, as, religion, offers, comfort, aatheism, should, not, be, adopted, we, should, definitely, ban, targeted, killing, because, the, loss, of, life, should, never, be, a, planned, event, whaling, is, part, of, a, great, number, of, cultures, we, should, not, ban, targeted, killing, as, it, is, the, only, way, to, deal, with, particular, criminals, who, are, otherwise, not, able, to, be, captured, or, killed, human, cloning, is, very, open, to, abuse, and, could, be, used, for, the, wrong, things, safe, spaces, should, be, abolished, as, this, it, just, makes, our, society, weak, fast, food, is, known, to, contain, unhealthy, fats, and, no, necessary, nutrients, collectivism, does, n't, allow, people, to, stand, up, on, their, own, for, what, they, believe, in, zoos, force, animals, into, an, existence, outside, of, their, natural, habitat, for, our, viewing, pleasure,   , it, is, not, right, to, subject, them, to, such, an, environment, judicial, activism, can, highlight, wrong, legislation, or, deliver, accurate, justice, that, can, not, be, addressed, through, the, existing, laws, cosmetic, surgery, promotes, a, capitalistic, society, that, focuses, on, solving, problems, with, money, rather, than, personal, acceptance, zero, tolerance, policies, are, helpful, as, they, stop, children, misbehaving, we, should, ban, whaling, because, there, is, very, little, profit, in, the, business, and, does, nothing, but, kill, fairly, rare, animals, too, many, choices, in, political, parties, separates, people, in, a, country, instead, of, helping, them, to, unite, we, should, not, adopt, gender, neutral, language, because, no, reason, to, change, the, way, people, have, been, speaking, for, hundreds, of, years, factory, farming, is, necessary, in, our, society, as, a, way, to, control, and, protect, the, environment, in, which, the, animals, are, living, so, they, are, not, subjected, to, disease, and, predators, cannabis, is, no, more, harmful, than, cigarettes, or, alcohol, and, no, more, addictive, than, the, two, it, 's, bad, enough, having, to, take, out, a, student, loan, in, the, first, place, but, even, more, students, from, poorer, backgrounds, will, be, reluctant, to, go, into, higher, education, if, their, student, loans, are, n't, subsidized, autonomous, cars, will, reduce, the, human, margin, of, error, to, near, zero, and, make, for, a, safer, commute, i, do, n't, think, tax, dollars, should, be, going, towards, researching, embryonic, stem, cells,    , there, is, much, better, usage, for, our, money, than, that,    , we, do, not, need, to, subsidize, this, telemarketing, targets, the, weak, and, encourages, them, to, buy, what, they, ca, n't, afford, private, military, companies, are, a, threat, to, our, democracy, and, should, not, be, tolerated, anymore, journalism, has, been, an, important, profession, atheism, is, a, valid, form, of, thinking, just, as, many, controlled, religions, we, should, adopt, and, accept, it, as, we, do, with, other, beliefs, all, avenues, should, be, looked, at, not, just, the, supposedly, straight, forward, collectivism, gives, the, group, priority, over, individual, needs, this, would, be, very, unfair, for, some, individuals, who, may, have, a, higher, or, different, need, than, the, majority, of, the, group, a, multi, party, system, allows, for, greater, choice, in, whom, to, vote, for,   , it, allows, each, citizen, to, vote, for, the, party, that, best, fits, their, beliefs, and, represents, their, ideology, programmes, will, always, evolve, to, make, better, use, of, trading, practices, so, holding, people, back, from, using, algorithmic, trading, will, only, serve, to, slow, down, progress, gay, people, have, suffered, alot, over, the, decades, and, should, be, entitled, to, have, a, parade, celebrating, their, sexuality, if, everything, was, spoken, about, gender, neutrally, then, no, one, would, be, offended, the, open, source, nature, of, wikipedia, means, anyone, can, add, gibberish, and, falsehood, in, its, contents, thereby, making, it, unreliable, missionary, work, has, helped, to, civilize, entire, socities, the, ability, to, keep, and, use, firearms, is, instrumental, in, a, person, 's, ability, to, persue, safety, life, and, liberty, many, people, use, religion, to, connect, with, their, family, as, well, as, loved, ones, that, are, no, longer, alive, losing, this, comforting, connection, would, be, devastating, for, some, private, military, companies, provide, additional, soldiers, in, places, where, it, is, necessary, adolescents, can, be, very, self, conscious, about, their, appearance, if, a, student, thinks, their, uniform, is, unflattering, it, may, cause, them, discomfort, and, embarrassment, we, should, legalize, organ, trade, because, many, people, who, are, in, need, of, organs, have, trouble, getting, good, organs, we, should, not, ban, private, military, companies, because, they, protect, people, banning, fast, food, is, an, example, of, regulations, which, take, away, our, right, to, freedom, we, should, abolish, the, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, as, this, right, has, gotten, out, of, hand, with, too, many, mass, shootings, the, olympic, games, are, too, expensive, to, be, held, whaling, should, be, banned, because, it, harms, economic, activity, that, 's, generated, by, whale, watching, certain, professions, such, as, police, officer, and, air, traffic, controller, have, mandatory, retirement, ages,   , to, ensure, that, the, person, who, is, responsible, for, the, safety, of, others, remains, competent, to, do, his, job, libertarianism, allows, the, expression, of, free, will, and, would, make, society, more, interesting, by, allowing, people, to, be, as, they, truly, are, bannabis, should, be, legalized, as, it, has, been, proven, to, have, medical, benefits, that, outweigh, any, negative, effects, it, will, also, remove, it, from, the, control, of, criminals, and, gangsters, cancelling, pride, parades, goes, against, what, they, stand, for,   , those, parades, are, vital, for, spreading, acceptance, gender, neutral, language, will, cause, confusion, if, we, do, n't, know, who, is, being, referred, to, it, is, unfair, on, those, being, bullied, to, punish, them, the, same, as, you, punish, the, bully, some, people, do, not, feel, capable, of, exercising, such, a, responsibility, zoos, trap, animals, into, a, meaningless, life, only, to, amuse, human, onlookers, cosmetic, surgery, is, dangerous, and, should, be, banned, those, authoring, articles, on, wikipedia, are, not, necessarily, experts, on, the, topic, and, there, is, risk, of, inaccurate, information, being, broadcast, we, would, end, up, in, bidding, wars, where, only, the, rich, could, be, helped, we, should, ban, human, cloning, because, playing, god, can, be, dangerous, we, should, limit, executive, compensation, for, national, ecomics, collectivism, is, unfair, to, large, populations, and, should, be, stopped, ceo, 's, make, 100, times, what, an, average, worker, make, and, they, do, not, actually, generate, any, capital, turn, out, figures, are, unacceptably, low, we, need, to, motivate, people, to, be, active, voters, for, a, representative, democracy, we, should, ban, algorithmic, trading, because, most, people, have, no, idea, how, it, works, and, if, it, is, good, for, them, or, not, zoos, are, n't, all, properly, regulated, and, some, animals, are, kept, in, appalling, conditions, they, should, be, left, in, their, natural, environment, we, should, limit, judicial, activism, as, it, goes, outside, the, set, laws, and, eventually, could, go, to, far, to, one, person, creating, their, own, agendas, autonomous, cars, will, allow, people, to, do, more, instead, of, wasting, time, in, traffic, compulsory, voting, would, make, the, election, practice, fairer, fast, food, is, good, for, busy, people, allowing, the, to, pick, up, something, to, eat, on, the, go, nuclear, weapons, create, such, irreversible, damage, that, we, should, all, agree, to, remove, them, as, an, option, some, fast, food, restaurants, offer, healthy, alternatives, and, provide, a, quick, nutritious, meal, on, the, go, most, whaling, is, done, under, controlled, situations, and, is, done, for, research, purposes, strict, capital,

olympic, games, allow, for, true, amateur, athletes, to, live, out, their, dreams, it, costs, too, much, to, build, for, the, games, and, never, use, those, buildings, again, sale, of, cannabis, should, not, be, legalized, because, it, is, a, dangerous, drug, and, as, such, is, a, public, health, concern, libertarianism, promotes, political, freedom, of, choice, as, its, core, value, and, is, the, ultimate, expression, of, democracy, missionary, work, should, be, banned, as, it, can, be, abused, and, vulnerable, people, can, be, taken, advantage, of, people, should, be, able, to, go, to, school, and, better, themselves, without, having, to, pay, back, thousands, of, dollars, when, they, graduate, as, americans, we, are, granted, the, right, of, due, process, sometimes, there, are, extenuating, circumstances, that, must, be, taken, into, account, parades, bring, in, homophobic, people, that, bully, the, members, of, the, parade, we, should, n't, ban, private, military, companies, as, they, are, doing, a, job, and, keeping, people, safe, an, austerity, regime, is, the, most, effective, way, to, reduce, the, national, debt, we, should, n't, abolish, the, three, strikes, law, because, it, is, necessary, to, ensure, society, understands, the, ramifications, of, repeated, ill, behavior, three, felonies, is, just, about, enough, as, far, as, i, ', m, concerned, zoos, bring, a, lot, of, money, in, which, can, be, spent, on, animal, research, and, stop, their, extinction, we, should, not, place, any, restrictions, on, freedom, of, speech, many, of, the, restrictions, are, arbitrary, and, unnecessary, such, as, the, gingerbread, man, becoming, the, gingerbread, person, the, use, of, child, actors, exploits, a, child, and, can, have, negative, effects, on, them, we, should, not, abolish, the, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, because, it, is, a, constitutional, right, to, own, weapons, to, protect, ourselves, telemarketing, is, annoying, for, people, as, they, do, not, request, a, phone, call, and, vunerable, people, such, as, the, elderly, often, feel, threatened, into, taking, part, safe, spaces, allow, individuals, a, place, to, feel, comfortable, without, having, to, worry, about, feeling, judged, for, who, they, are, or, whom, they, love, safe, spaces, equal, non, free, speech, spaces, and, that, is, against, the, law, we, should, definitely, oppose, collectivism, because, there, is, less, autonomy, in, terms, of, thoughts, and, ideas, everyone, will, just, go, along, with, the, group, an, executive, has, worked, hard, to, get, to, that, position, through, study, and, prior, work, experience, they, should, be, compensated, for, their, value, to, the, company, autonomous, cars, can, be, hacked, and, become, a, dangerous, weapon, for, evil, persons, austerity, regimes, hurt, the, common, man, by, reducing, support, for, schools, and, health, care, we, should, legalize, prostitution, since, it, should, be, out, in, the, open, controlled, and, supervised-, instead, of, hidden, this, is, most, efficient, way, to, improve, sex, workers, conditions, and, pave, their, way, to, independence, the, possession, of, nuclear, weapons, is, illegal, under, international, humanitarian, law, judicial, activism, undermines, the, rule, of, law, collectivism, enables, communities, to, work, together, for, the, greater, good, plastic, surgery, can, cause, many, complications, and, infections, and, does, not, address, the, underlying, self, esteem, issues, of, the, patient, whaling, is, wiping, out, species, for, little, in, return, people, should, be,   , free, to, worship, who, they, want, religion, can, instill, good, values, and, morals, into, people, subsidizing, journalism, could, raise, questions, about, bias, and, editorial, independence, safe, spaces, are, necessary, so, that, traditionally, marginalised, groups, can, interact, freely, without, fear, of, harm, and, oppression, we, should, adopt, athiesm, because, no, religion, will, stop, lots, of, wars, and, arguements, if, we, abolish, the, rights, then, companies, will, stop, developing, products, and, ideas, as, they, will, know, that, there, is, no, way, they, can, make, back, the, cost, of, r&d, and, so, will, run, at, losses, three, strikes, laws, are, unnecessary, because, states, already, have, ways, of, punishing, recidivism, more, harshly, space, exploration, does, n't, have, any, immediate, benefits, for, the, general, public, we, should, subsidize, wikipedia, because, wikipedia, helps, people, to, learn, about, any, and, everything, they, want, to, learn, about, all, schools, should, adopt, a, zero, tolerance, policy, as, kids, need, to, know, they, can, not, act, inappropriately, at, any, given, moment, when, in, school, a, multiparty, system, blurs, the, citizenship, of, a, vision, and, model, of, country, we, should, not, adopt, a, multiparty, system, because, it, would, waste, valuable, time, to, agree, if, capital, punishment, is, unfairly, applied, we, should, focus, on, fixing, that, not, abolishing, it, entirely, we, should, not, ban, cosmetic, surgery, because, it, could, help, a, disfigured, person, regain, confidence, tax, payers, should, n't, have, to, pay, for, other, people, to, have, an, education, when, they, dint, get, the, same, chances, in, the, interest, of, world, peace, we, should, adopt, atheism, and, would, then, avoid, religious, wars, too, much, drugs, depend, on, the, availability, of, cannabis, legalizing, it, will, make, development, of, these, drugs, quicker, we, should, not, subsidize, journalism, because, it, is, a, poor, use, of, public, money, when, things, like, healthcare, and, education, are, short, of, funding, we, should, not, adopt, libertarianism, because, people, 's, lives, are, better, when, they, know, they, have, a, social, safety, net, to, fall, back, on, and, that, they, wo, n't, starve, if, they, lose, their, job, subsidizing, journalism, would, bring, more, accurate, reporting, because, it, would, allow, for, the, hiring, of, more, qualified, reporters, gun, violence, is, out, of, control, and, the, only, solution, is, to, take, away, guns, the, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, is, one, of, the, tenets, of, our, country, missionary, work, is, risky, to, participate, in, whale, meat, has, high, levels, of, mercury, and, is, unhealthy, as, part, of, a, diet, zero, tolerance, sets, a, clear, and, specific, guideline, for, all, to, adhere, to, a, three, strikes, system, does, not, allow, for, people, to, be, treated, fairly, as, individuals, and, instead, is, used, as, a, one, size, fits, all, control, method, for, minority, populations, it, could, become, partial, to, whoever, pays, targeted, killing, may, help, avoiding, terrorists, attacks, and, is, a, very, useful, thing, three, strikes, laws, reduce, the, power, of, judges, and, discretion, in, the, court, room, making, judgments, shallower, economic, sanctions, can, help, force, countries, to, provide, better, treatment, for, the, common, people, of, that, country, the, three, strike, law, prohibits, reform, of, offenders, embryonic, stem, cell, research,   , can, lead, to, new, cures, for, diseases, space, travel, has, health, dangers, astronauts, and, space, tourists, face, risks, from, radiation, which, can, cause, illness, and, injure, organs, economic, sanctions, can, help, control, financial, situations, libertarianism, would, be, a, huge, mistake, especially, for, the, poor, in, our, nation, prayer, is, a, personal, choice, enforcing, school, prayer, may, expose, students, to, ideas, they, are, not, comfortable, with, three, strikes, laws, destroy, families, by, taking, away, parents, and, children, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, with, no, chance, of, parole, economic, sanctions, do, help, western, countries, to,   , avoid, the, spread, of, terrorism, the, countries, regular, citizens, are, the, ones, who, are, hurt, the, most, by, sanctions, we, should, not, ban, missionary, work, because, if, people, want, to, help, out, others, that, is, their, business, and, no, one, elses, we, should, ban, the, church, of, scientology, as, many, ex, members, report, manipulation, and, bullying, and, it, has, been, reported, to, be, a, cult, which, has, seperated, families, telemarketing, is, a, job, for, some, and, banning, it, would, take, jobs, away, we, should, subsidize, space, exploration, because, someday, we, may, have, to, leave, earth, behind, once, we, deplete, all, our, resources, or, because, of, a, nuclear, war, compulsory, voting, ensures, that, our, leaders, reflect, the, will, of, all, people, not, just, those, who, were, able, motivated, enough, to, make, it, to, the, polls, if, parents, agree, for, their, kids, to, do, acting, i, can`t, see, any, problem, with, it, there, is, nothing, that, can, come, from, space, research, that, will, help, the, country, so, why, waste, so, much, money, the, school, uniform, generates, in, the, student, respect, and, adherence, to, the, rules, eliminating, the, use, of, school, uniform, goes, against, the, establishment, of, routine, and, responsibility, towards, the, institution, minors, should, not, be, allowed, to, have, an, elective, cosmetic, surgery,   , their, bodies, are, still, growing, and, changing, and, should, be, allowed, to, mature, before, going, under, the, knife, algirithmic, trading, reduces, the, possibilty, of, error, and, just, furthers, profit, for, finance, companies, pride, parades, can, cause, increased, tensions, which, requires, more, police, protection,   , this, can, also, cause, fighting, to, break, out, this, is, absolutely, something, we, should, ban, because, children, should, n't, be, encouraged, to, be, dissatisfied, with, their, bodies, working, together, for, a, greater, good, favouring, the, less, well, off, and, giving, freedom, of, choice, can, only, benefit, society, as, a, whole, prayer, in, school, should, be, prohibited, because, it, violates, the, separation, of, prayer, and, state, autonomous, cars, leave, both, passengers, and, pedestrians, vulnerable, to, malicious, hacking, which, could, cause, wide, scale, destruction, we, should, end, the, use, of, economic, sanctions, because, it, causes, more, conflict, school, prayer, encourages, children, to, be, open, minded, and, learn, about, other, cultures, and, religions, uniforms, allow, students, to, look, the, same, and, not, have, to, follow, the, fashion, while, at, school, adopting, atheism, takes, away, the, freedom, of, worship, that, people, are, promised, in, this, country, pride, parades, allow, marginalized, groups, to, have, a, space, in, order, to, gather, and, celebrate, and, boost, their, self, esteem, very, often, prostitutes, are, the, most, vulnerable, in, society, and, have, drug, and, alcohol, problems, they, need, to, be, properly, protected, if, an, individual, has, created, any, property, it, is, his, to, determine, it, 's, use, legal, organ, trade, would, help, prevent, wait, lists, the, true, purposes, of, telemarketing, are, to, pressure, feeble, minded, people, into, buying, things, they, do, n't, really, want, and, to, make, it, easier, to, get, away, with, fraud, legalising, prostitution, can, only, be, beneficial, to, the, sex, workers, and, their, clients, from, a, safety, and, health, point, of, view, more, voters, would, boost, voter, turnout, if, a, person, wants, to, continue, working, that, is, their, right,   , they, should, not, be, forced, to, stop, based, on, some, arbitrary, rule, made, up, by, someone, being, a, citizen, of, your, country, requires, you, to, have, at, least, some, duty, to, the, nation, legalizing, prostitution, could, allow, for, regulations, that, make, prostitutes, and, the, people, that, use, their, services, safer, and, healthier, citizens, should, be, allowed, to, defend, themselves, with, lethal, force, in, a, life, or, death, situation, because, the, police, are, typically, slow, to, respond, to, such, situations, child, actors, are, necessary, and, children, can, learn, how, to, work, even, from, an, early, age, companies, should, be, able, to, pay, as, much, as, they, like, as, long, as, it, 's, above, minimum, wahe, student, loans, should, be, subsidized, as, this, allows, those, from, marginalized, or, poorer, sections, of, society, to, access, good, education, legalizing, prostitution, can, many, women, as, well, as, children,

they, are, exploited, for, the, benefit, of, a, paying, public, with, little, concern, about, their, happiness, of, welfare, since, intellectual, property, is, such, covers, such, a, broad, spectrum, it, is, difficult, to, prove, that, rights, have, been, infringed, leading, to, lengthy, legal, cases, and, should, therefore, be, abolished, it, would, make, people, who, are, gender, challenged,

everyone, has, the, right, to, bodily, autonomy, if, a, person, chooses, to, sell, his, or, her, body, for, sex, it, should, not, be, illegal, we, should, adopt, atheism, because, for, decades, we, have, proven, with, science, that, religious, explanations, are, incorrect, zoos, provide, the, only, places, for, some, endangered, species, to, survive, that, they, are, essential, and, we, should,

away, from, all, that, until, hollywood, is, safe, for, them, gender, neutral, language, should, be, adopted, so, that, society, can, progress, and, advance, does, it, really, matter, if, you, are, a, man, or, woman, anymore, it, should, n't, we, should, fight, for, the, abolition, of, nuclear, weapons, or, else, the, entire, world, will, destroy, itself, they, are, a, waste, of, public, resources,

likely, to, be, prosecuted, and, therefore, have, prior, offences, so, this, is, unfairly, applied, school, uniforms, keep, all, kids, equal, while, at, school, learning, and, that, is, a, great, thing, so, school, uniforms, should, remain, state, subsidies, for, journalism, will, make, journals, financially, dependent, on, the, government, which, will, allow, the, government, to, influence, what, news, gets, reported, and, how, the, reporting, is, done, executive, compensation, too, often, fails, to, deliver, and, as, such, causes, working, issues, therefore, it, should, not, only, be,

prison, over, population, since, more, offenders, are, put, away, for, a, longer, time, this, leads, to, worse, prison, conditions, and, more, violence, in, prisons, scientology, is, not, a, true, religion, it, is, a, sect, or, a, cult, which, brainwashes, it, 's, followers, and, makes, money, from, them, we, should, adopt, atheism, as, then, there, would, be, no, arguments, about, religion, which, seems, to, be, the, cause, of, most, wars, and, disagreements, in, society, people, would, sell, organs, because, to, them, money, is, more, important, than, health, putting, them, at, risk, a, person, should, be, allowed, to, choose, what, happens, to, their, bodies, school, uniforms, limit, the, ability, to, express, one, 's, self, gun, ownership, hurts, more, people, than, it, helps, keeping, journalist, in, work, helps, the, nation, keep, up, with, the, news, its, the, only, way, to, send, a, hard, message, targeted, killings, need, to, stop, because, the, bad, guys, need, to, be, caught, and, brought, to, trial, if, possible, the, risk, of, nuclear, war, has, made, great, powers, more, likely, to, turn, to, negotiation, and, cooperation, to, settle, disputes, and, abolishing, nuclear, weapons, would, make, war, less, costly, and, more, likely, mandatory, retirement, is, discriminatory, on, the, basis, of, age, which, is, an, immutable, characteristic, much, like, gender, or, race, in, that, one, has, no, control, over, it, people, have, the, right, to, choose, any, religion, they, with, atheism, should, not, be, forced, upon, them, school, uniform, makes, all, children, on, a, level, at, school, reducing, their, differences, in, background, and, wealth, to, unify, the, class, we, should, not, prohibit, school, prayer, because, it, would,

that, they, are, given, time, to, be, children, then, it, is, good, for, them, and, the, money, earned, will, give, them, freedom, as, adults, to, do, whatever, they, want, enforced, prayer, sessions, in, schools, indoctrinate, children, into, regressive, belief, systems, and, limit, their, ability, to, think, independently, for, themselves, and, so, should, be, removed, from, all, schooling,

to, report, the, news, regardless, of, whether, they, have, the, monetary, means, to, do, so, or, not, they, have, no, need, in, society, today, with, the, amount, of, military, we, have, nuclear, armed, nations, benefit, from, the, power, and, status, of, the, weapons, available, within, their, territory, limiting, executive, compensation, would, deter, executives, from, doing, their, job, correctly, it, is, sometimes, necessary, to, act, in, a, preemptive, manner, with, cases, of, truly, dangerous, terrorists, and, national, threats, reliance, on, the, normal, extradition, process, is, too, slow, and, can, cost, lives, the, brain, of, a, child, is, n't, fully, developed, and, it, is, n't, fair, to, have, such, harsh, penalties, on, them, prostitution, is, a, dangerous, profession, collectivism, gives, people, something, to, work, on, as, a, team, and, builds, relationships, let, the, free, market, determine, whether, telemarketing, is, a, viable, option, subsidizing, student, loans, will, enable, many, more, people, the, opportunity, to, attend, college, there, are, better, things, the, government, can, do, with, that, money, we, should, limit, executive, compensation, because, it, only, helps, the, rich, we, should, be, concentrating, on, and, spending, money, on, making, our, world, a, better, place, then, out, exploring, other, worlds, and, space, needlessly, the, possibility, of, extinction, as, a, result, of, nuclear, war, justifies, their, abolition, as, a, precaution, which, protects, all, of, humanity, we, should, n't, abolish, zoos, because, they, attract, visitors, and, money, to, be, able, to, put, back, into, the, zoo, for, animal, feed, and, vet, bills, when, nuclear, weapons, exist, in, one, place, they, are, always, at, risk, of, proliferating, to, the, most, dangerous, of, regimes, ending, mandatory, retirement, would, cause, people, to, work, longer, to, the, detriment, of, younger, job, seekers, space, exploration, is, a, drain, on, money, which, should, be, invested, in, looking, after, our, own, planet, therefore, we, should, not, subsidize, space, explorations, three, strikes, laws, act, as, a, very, effective, deterrent, to, crime, and, this, zero, tolerance, approach, has, been, been, responsible, for, making, cities, far, safer, zoos, do, so, much, for, the, conservation, of, animals, and, species, that, are, at, risk, of, being, extinct, and, they, should, not, be, abolished, i, think, it, is, a, very, appropriate, method, given, the, physical, and, psychological, violence, that, exists, in, schools, today, the, olympic, games, inspire, children, and, people, of, all, ages, to, enjoy, and, participate, in, sports, marijuana, use, harms, cognitive, function, especially, long, term, memory, and, is,

pride, parading, is, the, peaceful, place, for, lgbtq, people, to, express, themselves, freely, demonstrate, and, require, more, acceptance, from, other, people, of, all, the, different, stem, cells, embryonic, have, the, most, promise, for, scientific, research, we, should, not, end, the, use, of, economic, sanctions, because, in, the, long, term, they, can, achieve, significant, results, such, as, the, end, of, the, apartheid, regime, in, south, africa, telemarketing, is, a, form, of, sales, that, has, been, around, for, years, and, without, it, many, jobs, would, be, lost, it, is, difficult, to, get, a, job, without, a, degree, these, days, so, students, need, help, paying, to, obtain, one, all, beliefs, should, be, recognized, not, just, the, one, you, want, de, emphasizing, gender, in, every, day, conversation, will, have, long, term, benefits, for, humanity, libertarianism, and, the, seeking, to, maximise, freedom, and, personal, autonomy, is, a, key, value, and, it, should, be, central, to, the, constitution, the, military, should, be, wholly, the, domain, of, governments, because, they, provide, for, national, defense, a, private, military, company, is, 100, percent, for, profit, making, them, less, favorable, to, true, national, defense, the, olympic, games, should, be, abolished, as, they, have, become, a, massive, corporate, sponsorship, opportunity, that, is, subject, to, bribery, cheating, and, politics, its, unreasonable, to, go, into, another, country, for, the, intent, of, trying, to, convert, people, to, a, religion, it, is, everyone, 's, national, duty, to, at, least, vote, in, elections, we, should, not, because, everyone, needs, something, to, believe, in, and, if, there, was, no, religion, then, people, may, not, follow, laws, because, there, is, no, consequences, of, bad, actions, hell, compulsory, voting, would, ensure, that, everyone, becomes, engaged, in, the, political, process, and, it, would, be, the, true, voice, of, the, people, rather, than, the, voice, of, the, minority,   , who, vote, child, actors, are, robbed, of, their, childhood, and, can, face, much, emotional, turmoil, as, an, adult, from, missing, this, important, step, in, childhood, corporations, should, decide, for, themselves, whether, to, keep, a, worker, because, they, are, the, ones, directly, impacted, mandatory, retirement, encroached, on, corporate, rights, it, costs, too, much, money, to, explor, space, it, could, be, used, elsewhere, to, benefit, humans, everyone, has, opinions, about, themselves, and, should, be, in, control, of, how, they, treat, their, bodies, we, should, not, because, it, will, cause, much, less, accidents, on, the, road, we, should, abolish, the, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, because, too, many, guns, get, into, the, hands, of, kids, we, should, not, adopt, an, austerity, regime, because, the, global, economy, is, now, rapidly, growing, and, the, recession, is, years, behind, us, society, is, a, collective, and, the, most, good, comes, from, working, together, sex, selection, could, lead, to, gender, inbalance, in, some, societies, we, are, propagating, unnatural, and, unattainable, beauty, norms, by, fueling, an, industry, that, operates, on, those, that, can, afford, it, to, look, as, close, to, perfect, as, possible, with, this, law, the, victim, is, given, more, security, and, we, make, sure, that, the, perpetrator, does, not, relapse, in, other, crimes, libertarians, adopt, the, best, policies, regardless, of, which, party, espouses, them, whaling, provides, food, and, fuel, for, many, people, we, should, legalize, prostitution, because, it, gets, prostitutes, off, the, street, we, should, not, fight, for, the, abolition, of, nuclear, weapons, because, there, is, a, huge, risk, to, being, the, first, great, power, to, disarm, your, nuclear, arsenal, and, the, status, quo, keeps, us, all, safe, gender, neutral, language, should, be, adoppted, in, todays, society, where, peoples, sex,   , is, self, determined, and, more, fluid, because, it, avoids, offence, or, discrimination, executive, compensation, provides, motivation, for, executives, to, act, in, ways, that, are, beneficial, to, the, company, and, shareholders, parents, already, have, to, pay, a, lot, to, buy, supplies, for, their, kids, and, having, them, buy, school, uniforms, for, their, kids, is, too, much, of, an, added, cost, we, should, abolish, the, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, since, it, leads, to, more, violence, and, higher, crime, rights, there, is, too, much, scandal, and, controversy, that, comes, out, every, time, the, olympics, come, around, an, austerity, regime, unfairly, hits, hardest, those, least, able, to, cope, such, as, the, poor, and, the, sick, the, three, strike, law, is, too, strict, for, some, offenders, there, is, no, need, to, carry, a, fire, arm, it, just, leads, to, more, people, doing, the, same, algorithmic, trading, allows, larger, orders, to, happen, that, one, individual, could, n't, do, without, the, use, of, the, robots, judicial, activism, can, give, proper, justice, to, those, when, the, law, is, n't, completely, clear, collectivism, provides, a, common, goal, for, everyone, to, work, towards, we, should, not, legalize, prostitution, because, they, spread, too, many, deceases, so, we, need, to, get, rid, of, prostitution, collectivism, decreases, individual, rights, by, forcing, them, to, conform, to, what, the, group, deems, best, judicial, activism, should, not, be, limited, as, times, have, changed, circumstances, are, vastly, different, than, a, reason, why, an, initial, law, was, enacted, if, someone, has, worked, hard,   , to, climb, the, career, ladder, then, they, should, receive, a, reward, in, the, form, of, executive, compensation, space, exploration, is, expensive, and, money, should, not, be, wasted, on, something, that, will, probably, never, improve, life, on, earth, many, religions, have, toxic, aspects, but, we, can, not, pick, and, choose, which, ones,   , freedom, of, religion, applies, to, we, should, subsidize, journalism, as, it, is, a, key, element, to, investigating, wrong, doings, in, society, human, cloning, could, aid, medical, advances, and, should, therefore, be, allowed, legalizing, the, organ, trade, would, provide, life, saving, options, for, all, people, not, just, the, wealthy, ones, who, can, afford, to, buy, them, on, the, black, market, mandatory, retirement, is, a, form, of, discrimination, namely, ageism, we, can, not, allow, as, a, free, society, discrimination, of, any, kind, pride, parades, are, a, safe, place, for, like, minded, people, to, gather, and, support, each, other, we, should, ban, fast, food, because, it, is, essentially, just, making, obesity, the, most, convenient, lifestyle, we, should, abolish, the, three, strikes, laws, because, they, have, no, effect, in, detering, crime, legalizing, organ, trade, could, lead, to, some, horrific, situations, such, as, organs, being, taken, from, unwilling, donors, human, cloning, could, help, humanity, by, creating, being, with, similar, organ, types, that, could, be, donated, to, the, sick, we, need, these, people, but, not, if, they, are, a, nuisance, and, try, to, criticize, our, personal, beliefs, whaling, is, a, major, life, blood, for, some, communities, we, need, to, do, away, with, what, there, is, so, there, are, no, accidents, sex, selection, is, a, slippery, slope, that, may, lead, to, parents, picking, other, traits, to, screen, for, from, innocent, ones, like, hair, color, to, larger, ones, like, iq, private, military, companies, do, not, operate, under, the, normal, rules, of, engagement, and, are, sometimes, linked, to,

want, to, be, an, actor, it, is, their, choice, human, cloning, could, be, dangerous, in, the, wrong, hands, for, example, dictators, who, could, use, it, for, unethical, reasons, space, exploration,

they, ca, n't, do, certain, things,   , for, example, a, girl, should, be, able, to, have, aspirations, to, be, president, if, she, so, chose, algorithmic, trading, has, helped, the, trading, industry, due, to, the, high, level, of, accuracy, that, it, provides, there, is, no, human, error, marijuana, is, damaging, mentally, and, physically, everyone, has, a, right, to, celebrate, and, show, pride,   , otherwise, it, would, be, discrimination, three, strikes, laws, do, n't, consider, the, proportionality, of, the, crimes, committed, and, would, offer, disproportionate, punishment, to, people, who, commit, petty, crimes, we, do, n't, need, a, zero, tolerance, policy, that, punishes, students, harshly, for, small, things, targeted, killing, is, a, barbaric, practice, factory, farming, brings, meat, down, to, a, price, affordable, to, the, poorest, in, our, community, on, a, regular, basis, we, should, help, students, pay, to, be, educated, it, is, costly, and, loans, hamper, their, future, funding, comes, with, overt, or, covert, strings, attached, certain, criticisms, of, the, government, would, vanish, space, exploration, should, be, privatized, and, maybe, we, 'd, get, somewhere, we, should, not, prohibit, school, prayer, as, it, allows, students, to, practice, their, faith, in, their, everyday, life, people, need, a, place, to, go, when, they, need, help, they, need, somewhere, that, is, going, to, help, them, without, question, instead, of, forcing, them, back, into, the, situation, they, are, trying, to, get, away, from, it, would, not, be, possible, to, portray, society, realistically, if, child, actors, are, banned, because, children, are, an, important, part, of, many, dramas, nuclear, weapons, by, virtue, of, the, principle, of, mutual, assured, destruction, have, made, another, great, war, between, global, powers, impossible, human, cloning, should, not, be, banned, as, it, the, next, step, in, medicine, and, will, allow, for, transplantation, to, be, simpler, and, easier, to, perform, the, church, of, scientology, encourages, people, to, cut, themselves, off, from, friends, and, family, outside, the, church, this, isolation, is, potentially, damaging, for, children, as, it, limits, the, opinions, they, have, economic, sanctions, can, put, pressure, on, the, regime, in, power,   , it, reduces, their, ability, to, buy, weapons, of, oppression, and, the, ability, to, keep, their, economy, healthy,   , it, can, be, effective, in, the, right, circumstances, atheism, is, a, legitimate, belief, system, that, allows, a, person, to, think, for, himself, and, figure, life, out, in, his, own, way, it, should, be, adopted, the, same, as, other, belief, systems, are, adopted, sex, selection, can, possibly, destroy, the, natural, selection, and, over, balance, the, society, we, should, allow, young, people, to, express, their, individualism, private, military, companies, are, in, it, for, the, financial, gain, and, does, not, adhere, to, the, morals, of, civilian, casualties, mandatory, retirement, is, age, discrimination, and, should, n't, be, allowed, to, happen, cosmetic, surgery, can, cause, more, harm, then, good, and, if, not, done, properly, can, damage, a, person, for, the, rest, of, their, lives,   , it, can, also, take, up, surgical, rooms, that, are, needed, for, emergency, surgeries, if, telemarketing, is, done, appropriately, and, at, reasonable, hours, then, it, should, not, be, banned, algorithmic, trading, is, an, easy, way, to, keep, money, moving, and, to, make, a, profit, so, there, is, no, reason, to, ban, it, three, strikes, laws, help, people, realize, that, what, they, did, was, wrong, and, change, their, ways, before, they, end, up, in, jail, for, life, cosmetic, surgery, for, minors, will, only, cause, kids, to, get, surgery, to, meet, an, impossible, standard, of, looks, and, beauty, there, are, too, many, people, on, planet, earth, and, austerity, is, the, only, way, our, planet, will, survive, we, do, not, have, enough, resources, for, our, population, to, be, gluttonous, the, olympic, games, cost, vast, sums, of, money, to, the, host, country, that, would, be, better, spent, on, essential, services, such, as, healthcare, and, education, compulsory, voting, would, increase, voter, turnout, missionary, work, should, be, banned, as, some, people, can, be, forced, into, this, line, of, work, due, to, pressure, from, religious, communities, the, government, is, already, in, debt, and, subsidizing, space, exploration, is, not, necessary, we, should, not, show, preference, to, one, website, children, are, too, young, to, know, the, full, effects, of, such, a, lifestyle, and, history, has, shown, us, many, child, actors, are, abandoned, by, the, industry, and, often, fall, foul, to, substance, abuse, autonomous, car, development, should, be, continued, to, help, find, safe, renewable, energy, sourced, transportation, for, the, masses, pride, parades, allow, communities, to, be, open, and, free, about, their, lifestyles, in, a, way, that, everyone, else, can, all, the, time, they, are, fun, community, events, that, go, beyond, the, lgbtq, communities, private, military, companies, can, hold, bias, and, due, to, past, experiences, and, can, result, in, dangerous, sctivities, for, the, wrong, reasons, fast, food, is, the, main, culprit, for, our, current, obesity, epidemic,   , we, need, to, get, rid, of, it, to, restore, our, health, in, the, future, there, can, not, be, justification, for, taking, a, human, life, the, only, way, to, properly, deliver, this, message, is, to, abolish, death, penalty, freedom, of, religion, is, one, of, the, most, basic, human, rights, that, exist,   , just, because, someone, else, might, not, believe, in, scientology, does, n't, give, them, the, right, to, say, someone, else, ca, n't, believe, the, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, is, antiquated, as, it, was, utilized, to, form, militia, 's, during, times, of, conflict, and, war, and, is, no, longer, necessary, the, olympic, games, provide, addition, income, to, small, businesses, cannabis, is, a, hallucinogenic, product, that, can, harm, a, persons, memory, lower, their, inhibitions, and, cause, a, person, to, make, dangerous, choices, and, is, addictive, all, of, these, behaviors, can, be, destructive, we, should, not, adopt, an, austerity, regime, because, counter, cyclical, spending, leads, to, better, outcomes, for, the, economy, than, austerity, telemarketing, is, perfectly, fine, when, handled, by, telemarketers, appropriately, and, politely, with, respect, to, potential, customers, atheism, should, be, the, defacto, stance, as, it, is, the, only, provable, observance, of, reality, in, that, there, is, absolutely, no, evidence, to, prove, the, contrary, you, can, not, push, another, country, just, because, you, do, n't, approve, of, their, behaviors, a, zero, tolerance, policy, in, schools, is, a, very, old, fashioned, theory, and, it, has, failed, over, and, over, again, missionary, work, can, provide, assistance, to, people, who, need, it, we, should, not, because, it, will, be, much, cheaper, than, keeping, these, evil, people, in, prison, for, there, life, we, should, not, end, mandatory, retirement, because, people, need, to, retire, whether, they, realize, it, or, not, it, is, not, up, to, them, they, of, course, have, no, free, will, the, use, of, gender, pronouns, tends, to, single, out, one, gender, from, the, other, and, can, be, offensive, to, some, we, should, no, adopt, a, multi, party, system, because, nothing, would, ever, get, done, with, varying, points, of, view, pride, parades, are, a, fantastic, way, for, individuals, to, celebrate, their, identities, which, history, has, long, put, down, as, being, not, normal, or, labeled, as, a, disorder, missionary, work, can, be, viewed, as, the, exploitation, of, a, disadvantaged, culture, by, a, privileged, culture, state, subsidies, for, jouranalism, are, n't, supported, by, a, majority, of, the, populace, making, it, undemocratic, and, not, something, the, state, should, do, intellectual, property, rights, protect, those, who, have, spent, time, and, ingenuity, on, development, of, an, idea, and, ensures, they, can, be, rewarded, accordingly, for, their, inspiration, executive, compensation, encourages, corruption, banning, fats, food, should, be, obligatory, for, all, governments, as, hurting, people, health, legalizing, organ, trade, would, make, it, safer, by, moving, it, out, of, the, hands, of, unscrupulous, people, operating, in, the, black, market, embryonic, research, has, proven, effective, in, finding, cures, for, many, diseases, such, as, cancer, the, olympic, games, are, the, one, event, that, can, bring, all, countries, together, in, unity, and, should, never, be, abolished, the, interests, of, a, two, party, system, are, very, limited, and, we, need, to, expand, with, more, parties, to, cater, to, more, views, libertarianism, gives, us, real, freedom, and, keeps, the, government, out, of, our, lives, judges, by, definition, are, supposed, to, be, impartial, having, activist, judges, defeats, the, purpose, nuclear, weapons, should, be, abolished, because, they, are, just, an, easy, way, to, wipe, out, the, human, race, the, church, is, like, any, other, church, and, after, all, there, is, supposed, to, be, a, separation, of, church, and, state, capital, punishment, is, the, only, acceptable, punishment, for, some, heinous, crimes, because, they, are, so, evil, life, in, prison, is, not, enough, student, loans, is, a, help, for, those, who, do, not, have, resources, embyronic, stem, cell, research, uses, cells, that, would, otherwise, just, be, destroyed, we, should, not, ban, whaling, because, there, are, whale, species, that, could, be, sustainably, harvested, albeit, not, all, whale, species, executive, compensation, should, be, limited, when, there, are, losses, in, the, company, private, military, companies, are, often, run, by, former, military, men, and, women, and, provide, a, service, that, allows, the, military, to, concentrate, on, military, operations, we, could, not, support, economic, sanctions, as, it, only, hurts, both, countries, financially, in, the, long, run, we, should, not, abolish, intellectual, property, rights, because, it, 's, not, fair, for, people, to, steal, a, genius, idea, from, someone, else, if, we, chose, to, ban, one, religion, we, could, end, up, with, all, religions, banned, which, would, result, in, war, so, we, should, not, ban, the, church, of, scientology, adopting, gender, neutral, language, would, make, it, easier, to, be, inclusive, the, judicial, system, requires, independence, judicial, activists, undermine, this, independence, and, the, practice, should, be, limited, we, already, are, in, high, enough, debt, we, do, n't, need, to, make, it, worse, be, subsidizing, pointless, things, the, operating, personnel, of, these, companies, has, been, working, for, the, army, of, the, nation, this, type, of, company, keeps, them, active, and, always, ready, to, defend, if, necessary, we, should, oppose, collectivism, because, it, creates, echo, chambers, in, societies, that, makes, it, harder, for, individuals, to, give, their, thoughts, and, opinions, on, things, libertarianism, promotes, freedom, and, liberty, in, the, more, fair, form, for, all, the, foundation, of, our, country, is, built, on, these, ideas, there, is, more, equality, and, freedom, through, libertarianism, there, are, still, civilian, casualties, when, using, targeted, killing, the, national, debt, is, out, of, control, and, only, by, implementing, austerity, measures, will, we, be, able, to, reduce, the, budget, deficit, and, guarantee, the, country, 's, future, confining, animals, in, small, spaces, is, cruel, cannabis, can, potentially, provide, a, route, into, experimenting, with, harder, drugs, zoos, can, help, people, especially, those, with, little, money, to,   , discover, the, beauty, of, wildlife, and, learn, how, to, protect,   , endangered, species, we, should, ban, telemarketing, because, it, is, annoying, and, there, is, no, way, to, tell, if, the, offer, is, legitimate, zoos, are, great, educational, tools, and, it, is, also, a, safe, place, to, take, care, of, endangered, species, we, should, not, end, mandatory, retirement, because, the, current, system, in, countries, like, germany, where, this, is, common, is, not, broken, such, a, dramatic, change, to, a, language, would, have, a, hard, time, being, universally, adopted, and, would, be, difficult, to, enforce, he, has, already, served, as, a, gender, neutral, pronoun, in, the, past, the, tax, payers, would, have, to, pay, for, the, subsidization, of, student, loans, in, the, end, it, would, be, better, to, reform, the, entire, university, system, instead, the, school, is, designed, to, educate, not, to, accept, student, abuse, cosmetic, surgery, can, provide, boost, in, confidence, everyone, should, have, the, right, to, feel, comfortable, i, do, not, support, that, decision, is, that, without, them, there, would, be, many, terrorists, is, a, measure, that, helps, a, lot, to, this, society, zoos, are, an, educational, and, entertaining, tool, and, the, animals, are, well, fed, and, cared, for, we, should, because, times, are, changing, and, people, are, not, sure, of, their, gender, anymore, so, it, stops, people, being, offended, i, think, it, takes, up, too, much, valuable, police, resources, chasing, recreational, cannabis, smokers.also, many, people, with, health, conditions, find, cannabis, beneficial, to, them, the, uniformity, of, clothing, creates, a, sense, of, belonging, and, a, collective, identity, which, encourages, camaraderie, between, students, and, this, allows, for, greater, focus, on, studies, compulsory, voting, would, ensure, that, voting, is, fair, and, equal, algorithmic, trading, might, be, good, for, those, starting, out, since, it, takes, all, the, guess, work, out, criminals, are, often, kept, on, death, row, for, many, years, suffering, in, anticipation, of, their, death, this, makes, capital, punishment, more, severe, than, just, depriving, the, criminal, of, life, they, are, environmentally, friendly, and, can, help, minimize, traffic, congestion, the, use, of, cannabis, does, not, stop, there,   , many, go, for, the, next, high, of, hashish,   , then, on, to, other, drugs,   , cannabis, should, not, be, allowed, to, stop, this, progressions, prostitution, does, n't, pose, any, larger, physical, threat, to, the, individual, than, other, manual, labor, jobs, dancers, destroy, their, bones, and, construction, workers, their, backs, if, those, are, legal, prostitution, needs, to, be, as, well, wearing, uniforms, decreases, discrimination, against, children, who, do, not, have, enough, money, to, buy, a, lot, of, clothing, this, measure, allows, to, move, pieces, in, the, companies, and, refresh, the, work, schemes, and, to, adapt, to, the, new, times, nuclear, weapons, prevent, certain, countries, being, attacked, and, help, to, keep, world, peace, the, lgbt, world, has, suffered, and, fought, greatly, for, equal, rights, they, deserve, to, have, a, parade, or, march, in, honor, of, such, we, should, not, ban, the, use, of, child, actors, because, then, movies, and, shows, would, n't, have, any, children, in, them, we, should, end, mandatory, retirement, these, days, people, need, to, work, longer, to, afford, to, live, because, of, inflation, we, should, not, subsidize, embryonic, stem, cell, research, because, these, scientists, have, been, working, on, this, a, long, time, executives, have, earned, their, compensation, and, should, not, be, capped, on, what, they, can, earn, as, this, would, be, and, overreach, into, company, affairs, it, is, unfair, to, assassinate, others, as, a, surprise, and, out, of, battlefield, multi, party, systems, bring, diversity, to, politics, and, giving, more, voices, to, the, population, we, should, nt, because, they, are, helping, animals, that, might, be, going, extinct, to, help, breed, we, should, ban, private, military, companies, because, it, relies, too, much, on, government, funding, fast, food, is, cheap, and, easy, and, is, often, the, only, way, poor, people, can, feed, their, families, if, you, ban, fast, food, these, people, wo, n't, have, enough, food, to, get, thru, til, their, next, check, comes, when, newspapers, worry, more, about, the, bottom, line, than, the, headlines, the, quality, of, the, papers, goes, down, resulting, in, poor, pop, journalism, that, panders, to, the, public, and, the, advertisers, this, type, of, investigations, always, end, up, perverting, and, end, up, fulfilling, dark, objectives, factory, farming, requires, a, load, of, workforce, and, provides, a, lot, of, jobs, opportunities, intellectual, property, rights, limit, the, information, people, can, use, some, people, just, do, n't, have, an, opinion, about, who, to, vote, for, adopting, gender, neutral, language, will, cost, lots, of, money, to, fix, signs, letters, forms, etc, there, are, still, people, that, live, off, of, whaling, and, banning, it, would, take, away, their, food, and, income, legalizing, prostitution, could, empower, women, and, make, them, safer, multi, party, systems, encourage, the, formation, of, weak, and, unstable, coalitions,

not, be, able, to, get, to, other, places, we, should, n't, adopt, a, zero, tolerance, policy, in, schools, because, it, could, cause, kids, to, be, wrongfully, punished, due, to, misunderstandings, for, example, protecting, themselves, against, a, bully, missionary, work, helps, many, people, who, are, in, distress, sex, selection, could, lead, to, genetic, abnormalities, and, start, society,

or, differing, religions, they, are, a, waste, of, money, building, hype, for, a, short, event, money, will, be, better, spent, elsewhere, collectivism, provides, no, incentive, for, people, to, work, hard, because, they, have, no, opportunity, to, become, wealthy, we, should, stop, the, development, of, autonomous, cars, because, autonomous, cars, are, bad, idea, very, dangerous, wikipedia, has, been, supported, by, voluntary, donations, for, too, long,   , subsidizing, it, would, give, it, more, credibility, and, would, allow, the, volunteers, to, continue, to, update, it, with, the, most,

the, people, we, should, not, subsidize, space, exploration, as, there, are, far, more, important, and, urgent, issues, to, deal, with, on, earth, at, this, time, there, is, too, much, gun, violence, and, too, many, innocent, people, are, dying, we, need, an, educated, workforce, so, the, loan, rate, students, take, should, be, low, and, subsidised, to, get, this, workforce, we, can, not, allow, the, cloning, of, humans, it, goes, against, the, laws, of, god, and, the, laws, of, nature, we, should, end, economic, sanctions, as, they, provide, no, real, value, targeted, killing, should, be,

that, are, in, their, interest, we, should, not, abolish, safe, spaces, because, people, with, ptsd, need, these, spaces, to, overcome, their, trauma, zoos, keep, wild, animals, locked, up, in, areas, smaller, than, they, are, used, to, in, the, wild, and, it, is, not, natural, for, them, atheism, could, be, of, great, benefit, because, it, would, foster, more, scientific, ideas, which, could, prevent, our, demise, from, global, warming, and, other, looming, challenges, intellectual, property, rights, serve, to, prevent, the, sharing, of, information, and, ideas, which, would, allow,

nuclear, proliferation, as, more, countries, with, nuclear, weapons, increases, their, deterrent, effect, libertarians, stand, for, everyone, being, allowed, to, have, the, most, freedom, possible, which, most, people, usually, want, anyway, if, they, can, kill, someone, who, has, done, or, is, planning, on, doing, something, to, harm, americans, then, why, not, target, them, and, kill, them, zoos, are, an, excellent, way, to, provide, entertainment, and, togetherness, for, families, they, provide, activities, that, no, other, venue, can, provide, they, should, not, be, abolished, organ,

do, n't, see, a, problem, we, should, not, adopt, libertarianism, because, the, business, cycle, would, destroy, the, country, 's, economy, without, regulation, austerity, makes, times, tougher, for, everyone, capital, punishment, is, a, barbaric, act, that, illustrates, to, people, that, murder, is, a, viable, option, and, codified, in, law, if, it, ai, n't, broke, do, n't, fix, it, it, is,

space, exploration, would, help, accomplish, this, the, most, basic, right, we, have, is, freedom, of, religion, and, it, is, very, strong, personal, belief,   , atheism, strips, that, away, and,

idea,    , i, do, n't, believe, it, would, change, the, results, anyways, by, subsidizing, student, loans, we, can, remove, one, of, the, stressors, from, continuing, education, a, formal, school, prayer, can, not, properly, be, considered, as, the, free, exercise, of, religion, the, prohibition, of, school, prayer, is, wholly, compatible, with, the, free, exercise, of, religion, when, everything, else, fails, the, government, should, be, allowed, to, curb, all, superfluous, spending, within, whaling, is, quite, a, profitable, profession, atheism, should, be, the, norm, for, a,

on, other, more, ethical, areas, of, study, libertarianism, should, not, be, adopted, as, it, will, give, too, much, power, to, businesses, and, rich, people, to, do, whatever, they, want, a, zero, tolerance, policy, gives, no, leeway, for, administrators, in, cases, where, the, crime, may, not, be, so, serious, churches, in, general, are, just, cult, and, should, be, banned, our, society, needs, to, be, able, to, label, and, identify, a, person, as, a, male, or, female, for, many, reasons, such, as, taxes, employment, health, care, etc, so, we, should, not, adopt, a, gender, neutral, language, financial, trading, is, already, a, destructive, and, unethical, sector, of, the, economy, and, allowing, algorithmic, trading, does, not, make, it, any, less, so, people, selling, organs,

it, will, negate, the, choices, of, others, wikipedia, is, not, a, reliable, source, for, information, and, we, should, not, waste, money, on, it, we, should, limit, judicial, activism, since, that,

defence, of, nations, mandatory, retirement, should, be, ended, because, it, could, force, many, seasoned, veterans, to, retire, every, year, it, is, important, that, student, loans, are, granted, because, it, helps, you, increase, your, quality, of, life, and, your, economic, potential, the, cost, of, an, education, is, unaffordable, for, those, who, might, most, benefit, from, it, fast, food, can, lead, to, obesity, if, eaten, too, often, banning, it, would, mean, people, have, less, access, and, obesity, levels, would, fall, missionary, work, is, very, dangerous, for, the, people, involved, and, provides, little, benefit, to, those, being, ministered, to, by, subsidizing, space, exploration, we, can, work, toward, colonizing, other, planets, and, reduce, over, population, on, earth, we, should, adopt, an, austerity, regime, because, it, would, help, to, reduce, unnecessary, spending, the, poor, and, less, fortunate, will, always, be, hurt, unfairly, by, austerity, measures, the, most, obvious, reason, to, oppose, is, the, danger, that, an, innocent, person, is, killed, due, to, the, fact, that, mistakes, are, made, witnesses, can, be, wrong, in, what, they, saw, and, lawyers, can, make, a, hash, of, defending, a, case, bills, rise, just, to, pay, them, their, huge, bonuses, people, are, not, always, aware, of, their, failing, mental, faculties, and,

before, its, birth, the, whales, are, the, ambassadors, of, the, sea, and, an, icon, of, the, struggle, to, protect, the, planet, they, must, prohibit, whaling, we, should, ban, algorithmic, trading, because, is, difficult, in, some, economics, embryonic, stem, cell, research, should, be, subsidized, to, speed, up, the, rate, that, cures, for, serious, illness, are, identified, speedily, we, should, limit, executive, compensation, because, this, would, help, support, all, of, the, workers, in, a, company, this, is, an, unnatural, process, that, should, be, against, the, law, embryonic,

should, be, forced, to, vote, it, goes, against, the, principles, of, our, nation, and, its, freedoms, it, is, a, right, but, that, does, n't, mean, anyone, has, to, do, it, embryonic, stem, cell, research, has, the, potential, to, open, up, a, whole, new, field, of, healthcare, and, medicine, telemarketing, is, too, often, a, waste, of, time,   , in, an, age, where, most, people, have, ways, to, see, who, is, calling, the, calls, rarely, if, ever, actually, get, through,   , it, 's, time, to, find, a, new, way, legalizing, sex, selection, will, help, parents, to, have, the, exact, family, makeup, they, have, always, dreamed, of, voter, turnout, these, days, are, dropping, steadily, so, we, need, to, make, everyone, vote, to, show, the, true, representation, of, the, people, space, exploration, is, an, expensive, vanity, project, and, subsidization, could, be, abused, by, military, and, private, interests, sex, selection, allows, families, to, be, balanced, uniforms, remove, some, types, of, peer, pressure, surrounding, students, appearance, the, more, rights, we, have, as, individuals, the, happier, we, are, missions, can, provide, much, needed, infrastructure, and, healthcare, projects, the, use, of, economic, sanctions, should, be, ended, because, it, is, important, to, keep, a, good, relationship, with, the, countries, we, trade, with, we, should, not, adopt, atheism, because, it, is, not, a, religion, people, have, a, right, to, vote, and, they, also, have, a, right, not, to, vote, if, they, do, n't, like, any, of, the, candidates, executive,

events, that, could, take, place, is, taking, it, too, far, we, should, abolish, the, three, strikes, law, it, does, n't, deter, crime, and, it, is, expensive, to, implement, because, it, means, more, people, will, be, prison, for, life, taxpayers, do, n't, deserve, to, pay, for, that, nuclear, weapons, prevent, conflicts, from, dragging, onward, because, once, they, are, used, involved, countries, lose, the, motivation, to, continue, fighting, re, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, everyone, should, have, a, right, to, be, happy, some, pride, parades, can, get, overtly, sexual, blurring, the, line, of,

anyone, is, entitled, to, believe, in, whatever, they, want, god, or, no, god, the, church, of, scientology, is, a, choice, of, religion, by, many, and, a, constitutional, right, to, freedom, of,

to, relate, to, cosmetic, surgery, is, a, personal, choice, that, people, should, be, allowed, allowing, sex, selection, would, alleviate, the, depression, faced, by, mother, 's, who, truly, wanted, one, gender, over, another, killing, is, against, the, law, so, it, should, be, banned, we, can, not, legalize, the, trade, of, human, organs, it, will, open, up, an, exploitative, industry, that, preys, on, people, with, money, problems, the, death, penalty, can, provide, families, of, victims, with, some, closure, which, may, help, them, to, deal, with, their, suffering, legalizing, prostitution, would, allow, for, regulations, and, benefits, that, would, help, sex, workers, via, offering, protection, with, rights, granted, to, legal, employment, as, well, as, financial, prosperity, they, are, a, valuable, deterrant, to, having, another, world, war, cooperation, among, countries, is, essential, nowadays, avoiding, armed, conflict, when, one, country, 's, terrorizing, others, by, the, use, of, economic, sanctions, is, a, great, solution, to, return, that, country, back, more, cooperation, algorithmic, trading, is, legal, and, all, traders, have, access, to, some, sort, of, computer, aided, tools, you, can, require, voting, but, you, ca, n't, force, people, to, educate, themselves, about, the, candidates, and, issues, the, threat, of, mutually, assured, destruction, is, the, only, thing, that, keeps, democracy, safe, from, tin, pot, dictators, hence, we, need, to, keep, nuclear, weapons, some, people, need, a, safe, space, to, be, safe, from, those, out, to, hurt, them, and, they, should, be, available, zoos, keep, animals, in, captivity, and, deny, them, the, right, to, their, natural, environment, therefore, they, should, be, abolished, the, church, of, scientology, should, be, banned, as, it, is, a, cult, not, a, religion, factory, farming, should, be, banned, because, meat, quality, goes, down, when, animals, are, n't, living, in, optimal, conditions, and, therefore, people, are, having, to, eat, inferior, meat, factory, farming, treats, live, animals, as, a, disposable, item, fast, food, leads, to, poor, choices, which, lead, to, diseases, like, diabetes, and, obesity, school, prayer, violates, the, seperation, of, church, and, state, there, are, always, exceptions, to, everything, so, zero, tolerance, policies, are, not, good, because, it, does, n't, allow, for, any, exceptions, we, should, ban, whaling, because, it, is, leading, to, the, extinction, of, whales, atheism, will, destroy, the, world, by, unleashing, godless, people, running, the, government, with, no, morals, or, ethics, and, should, not, be, adopted, collectivism, will, ultimately, fail, because, it, is, at, odds, with, basic, self, preservation, it, will, prevent, misgendering, an, individual, the, olympic, games, pits, countries, against, each, other, and, can, increase, levels, of, discrimination, when, athletes, compete, so, therefore, it, should, be, banned, they, may, sell, weapons, to, countries, that, would, use, them, inappropriately, unlike, prison, sentences, the, death, penalty, is, irreversible, and, irreparable, we, should, ban, factory, farming, as, animals, are, kept, in, cramped, conditions, a, multi, party, system, allows, a, greater, freedom, of, choice, for, voters, to, express, their, democratic, right, to, vote, for, policies, they, would, like, to, implimented, the, three, strikes, law, teaches, criminals, you, will, no, longer, be, able, to, keep, committing, crimes, and, getting, away, with, it, we, should, n't, subsidize, wikipedia, because, pages, on, wikipedia, is, user, created, and, is, n't, always, accurate, without, capital, punishment, we, would, have, more, problems, with, over, crowding, in, prisons, the, olympic, games, bring, vast, economic, benefit, to, local, communities, both, through, regeneration, projects, and, the, influx, of, vistors, spending, their, cash, libertarianism, puts, too, much, focus, on, the, individual, and, can, lead, to, selfishness, and, not, enough, focus, on, society, as, a, whole, we, should, n't, legalize, prostitution, because, it, may, cause, higher, percentage, of, drug, rates, and, crimes, along, with, prostitution, rates, mandatory, retirement, helps, keep, the, number, of, workplace, incidents, down, austerity, in, fiscal, policy, usually, results, in, spending, cuts, to, those, areas, of, society, who, need, it, most, telemarketing, can, help, companies, reach, a, wider, audience, human, cloning, is, far, from, being, perfected, and, can, lead, to, major, unethical, behavior, by, geneticists, that, can, result, in, grave, mistakes, and, horrific, experiments, if, you, kill, or, rape, someone, you, deserve, to, die, cannabis, is, a, holistic, and, natural, cure, for, cancer, patients, and, should, therefore, be, legalized, we, should, not, because, we, are, messing, with, the, natural, order, of, things, and, can, cause, more, problems, we, should, adopt, libertarianism, as, it, would, be, a, system, that, might, individuals, have, a, fair, chance, in, life, other, than, just, two, major, political, parties, a, zero, tolerence, is, too, harsh, children, get, reprimanded, for, even, the, most, innocent, act, no, one, individuals, life, is, any, more, intrinsically, important, or, valuable, than, any, other, person, 's, life, and, therefore, we, should, build, societies, that, value, the, collective, and, general, public, over, the, individual, legalising, prostitution, could, lead, to, more, people, becoming, involved, in, organised, crime, one, of, the, most, basic, human, rights, is, the, freedom, of, religion, and, asking, anyone, to, give, up, that, right, to, believe, in, whatever, they, choose, is, wrong, three, strike, laws, give, a, clear, message, to, offenders, who, may, be, in, danger, of, re, offending, that, doing, so, would, be, met, with, more, severity, than, their, first, offense, that, way, it, works, as, a, clear, deterent, it, is, a, decision, that, only, parents, can, make, until, they, are, old, enough, to, decide, an, austerity, regime, will, help, the, european, economy, get, out, of, a, recession, intellectual, property, rights, eliminate, competition, which, causes, higher, prices, we, should, abolish, intellectual, property, rights, because, new, ideas, are, often, an, extension, of, old, ideas, and, intellectual, property, rights, can, therefore, inhibit, creativity, we, need, to, ban, whaling, to, protect, whales, from, going, extinct, three, strikes, is, too, many, in, some, cases,   , if, people, know, they, have, three, chances, they, will, not, be, deterred, from, using, that, to, their, advantage, mutually, assured, destruction, is, a, crucial, method, of, preventing, actual, conflict, and, disaster, cloning, would, have, strict, regulations, on, how, to, handle, clones, and, ethical, dilemmas, scientific, advancements, made, while, working, towards, cloning, can, advance, the, human, race, we, should, not, adopt, an, austerity, regime, because, austerity, only, made, countries, like, greece, and, argentina, poorer, the, organ, trade, would, allow, for, more, lives, to, be, saved, or, improved, missionary, work, brings, aid, to, those, in, dire, circumstances, while, introducing, faith, into, the, lives, of, those, that, will, benefit, from, the, introductory, by, missionaries, nuclear, weapons, create, unnecessary, political, tension, the, olympics, bring, people, together, and, form, fun, rivalries, between, countries, all, vying, for, a, top, spot, among, the, world, 's, athletes, the, world, can, not, be, at, the, mercy, of, a, few, countries, with, such, power, to, destroy, people, should, be, free, to, worship, and, pray, in, any, way, that, they, choose, it, is, a, fundamental, right, many, people, that, are, forced, into, retirement, often, do, not, have, the, means, of, supporting, themselves, financially, and, so, either, turn, to, part, time, low, wage, work, or, welfare, to, sustain, themselves, we, should, abolish, safe, spaces, because, there, are, better, ways, to, protect, people, with, ptsd, like, content, warnings, rather, than, safe, spaces, we, should, not, abolish, safe, spaces, as, people, need, somewhere, to, feel, safe, if, they, are, persecuted, if, someone, is, willing, to, sell, an, organ, that, should, be, their, right, we, should, legalize, cannabis, because, it, is, harmless, school, prayer, should, nt, be, imposed, on, pupils, as, we, all, have, different, values, and, beliefs, and, live, in, a, multi, cultural, society, we, should, adopt, gender, neutral, language, so, nobody, will, get, offended, austerity, regimes, can, cause, widespread, unemployment, space, exploration, is, a, good, adventure, our, planet, is, in, a, future, risk, of, extinct, and, we, should, best, prepare, our, refuge, in, space,

rights, because, people, should, have, the, right, to, do, what, they, want, with, their, ow, property, without, executive, compensation, talent, will, be, lost, to, other, countries, child, actors, are, important, so, programs, can, show, people, of, ages, and, are, reflective, of, society, child, actors, are, an, important, part, of,   , the, industry, and, are, needed, to, reflect, people, accurately, they, prevent, people, from, being, able, to, express, their, opinions, that, might, bother, someone, school, uniforms, do, not, limit, self, expression, students, still, have, weekends, and, holidays, to, pick, their, own, outfits, executives, that, award, their, own, salaries, have, shown, they, can, not, show, restraint, we, should, ban, private, military, companies, as, they, are, difficult, to, legislate, and, it, is, difficult, to, monitor, the, operations, and, ensure, they, are, legal, and, ethical, mandatory, uniform, policies, denying, parents, rights, to, raise, children, without, government, intervention, cannabis, is, a, gateway, drug, that, can, lead, people, to, try, harder, drugs, so, it, should, remain, illegal, a, zoo, provides, care, for, animals,

habits, for, life, allowing, unfettered, libertarianism, will, result, in, more, crime, and, more, income, disparity, we, should, cancel, pride, parades, because, they, put, unsavory, ideas, into, our, children, 's, heads, autonomous, cars, are, simply, the, next, logical, step, in, transportation,   , years, ago, people, would, have, said, all, cars, are, dangerous, and, we, should, all, stick, to, horse, and, buggy, instead, destroying, nuclear, bombs, would, work, to, a, nations, disadvantage, because,   , they, will, be, vulnerable, to, attacks, consensus, can, become, difficult, in, multi, party, systems, libertarianism, is, better, than, anything, else, at, keeping, peace, legalizing, prostitution, will, make, sex, workers, safer, because, they, will, no, longer, have, to, hide, be, ruled, by, criminals, or, judged, as, ones, there, is, a, possibility, that, the, servers, could, be, hacked, and, alter, algorithmic, programming, which, would, cause, widespread, panic,

it, is, helpful, for, the, judiciary, to, take, public, action, should, they, wish, to, do, so, as, it, demonstrates, that, they, are, human, we, should, ban, private, military, companies, because,

choose, to, cannabis, creates, a, stoner, subculture, which, is, a, blight, on, our, society, a, legalised, trade, would, disproportionately, harm, those, from, poorer, economic, backgrounds, legitimising, the, huge, medical, risks, involved, telemarketing, is, a, nuisance, that, antagonises, potential, customers, of, a, business, there, are, many, more, practical, realms, of, scientific,

should, nt, be, banned, if, its, used, in, the, right, context, as, in, the, case, of, terrorists, who, might, be, killing, innocent, people, many, child, actors, are, put, under, a, huge, amount, of, pressure, to, perform, well, and, can, be, denied, most, of, their, childhood, by, unscrupulous, adults, that, only, want, to, profit, from, their, talents, legalizing, prostitution, will, help, destigmatize, sex, in, society, more, broadly, and, allow, people, to, feel, individually, empowered, pride, parades, have, become, dangerous, because, right, wing, opponents, have, tried, to, disrupt, them, with, violence, different, people, age, differently, so, if, a, person, can, phyisically, and, mentally, handle, a, job, the, more, power, to, them, people, deserve, to, have, the, best, trading, options, in, a, society, full, of, freedoms, should, not, impose, a, unique, way, of, manifesting, religious, beliefs, therefore, praying, should, be, something, that, is, done, at, home, not, at, school, the, olympic, games, promotes, racism, and, social, exclusion, in, favor, of, a, good, public, image, for, the, host, people, should, be, free, to, choose, for, themselves,

that, their, age, dictates, they, can, no, longer, do, appropriately, in, some, cases, cosmetic, surgery, is, essential, such, as, after, accidents, and, therefore, should, n't, be, banned,

even, if, they, worship, a, science, fiction, novel, this, is, needed, in, areas, where, the, population, is, unequal, when, only, one, sex, is, the, majority, that, population, would, eventually,

we, have, a, legal, obligation, to, keep, the, separation, of, church, and, state, we, ca, n't, allow, prayer, in, schools, as, this, would, violate, that, journalism, needs, diversitiy, desperately, because, only, six, corporations, control, ninety, percent, of, all, media, with, the, rise, of, racism, and, white, supremacy, we, should, adopt, libertarianism, into, our, society,    , allowing, for, open, borders, and, anyone, and, everyone, to, come, here, and, live, the, life, we, all, want, libertarianism, would, lead, to, crumbling, infrastructure, without, taxes, to, fund, the,

advantage, of, a, multi, party, system, is, that, voters, have, a, choice, of, which, political, party, they, can, choose, to, elect, sex, selection, should, not, be, legalized, because, it, is,

unnecessary, let, children, be, children, by, imposing, economic, sanctions, against, a, country, you, will, force, them, to, change, the, way, they, are, doing, things, because, it, creates, a, hardship, for, the, citizens, who, will, in, turn, rebel, against, the, government, cannabis, should, be, not, be, legalized, because, it, is, a, mind, altering, drug, that, has, many, negative, side,

there, that, it, needs, to, be, banned, before, we, have, a, bunch, of, freaks, walking, the, earth, we, need, to, do, away, with, intellectual, property, rights, so, it, does, n't, slow, down, innovation, missionaries, help, feed, the, hungry, build, housing, and, educate, people, so, we, should, not, stop, them, even, if, they, are, advocating, their, personal, religious, beliefs, at, the,

lead, down, a, slippery, slope, of, screening, for, other, genetic, factors, hair, color, handedness, etc, where, will, it, stop, gender, neutral, language, is, helpful, in, making, everyone, in, a,

religions, if, there, are, 3, minor, offenses, there, is, no, need, to, overly, punish, someone, we, should, legalize, organ, trade, because, it, will, be, better, monitored, than, having, organs,

our, modern, world, and, help, people, have, a, cheap, meal, human, cloning, opens, up, a, whole, new, level, of, ethics, such, as, the, rights, of, the, clone, that, we, are, unprepared, to, handle, legally, and, morally, it, is, unjust, to, force, government, employees, to, kill, a, person, the, way, capital, punishment, does, pride, parades, cause, too, many, problems, in, the, community,   , they, disrupt, the, peace, and, cause, a, lot, of, litter, we, should, legalize, cannabis, for, best, healthy, of, body, nuclear, weapons, are, an, expensive, to, build, and, maintain, these, resources, could, be, put, to, better, use, in, moderation, fast, food, can, be, a, treat, or, convenient, meal, for, busy, people,   , we, should, allow, people, to, enjoy, it, intellectual,

dangerous, weapon, to, not, only, the, driver, but, everyone, around, him, school, uniforms, keep, school, from, becoming, a, fashion, show, we, should, not, legalize, sex, selection, because, it, might, cause, an, unbalanced, society, capital, punishment, is, a, deterrent, for, others, to, commit, the, same, crimes, we, should, legalize, organ, trade, because, people, would, benefit, by, having, a, better, life, if, a, private, military, company, sends, it, 's, employees, to, dangerous, places, then, it, saves, the, lives, of, soldiers, who, wo, n't, be, sent, there, cosmetic,

would, spread, many, diseases, we, should, n't, ban, targeted, killing, because, it, is, a, legitimate, tool, in, foreign, wars, to, take, out, the, biggest, enemies, we, need, to, use, all, the, tools, available, to, us, we, should, not, introduce, compulsory, voting, because, some, people, that, are, unable, to, read, and, or, write, will, be, voting, private, military, companies, are,

to, violence, there, is, no, need, for, oppressive, restraints, on, people, 's, behaviour, so, we, should, adopt, libertarianism, a, multi, party, system, allows, for, more, unqualified, people, to, get, into, the, race, the, international, community, has, already, acknowledged, that, nuclear, weapons, are, bad, by, signing, a, number, of, nuclear, nonproliferation, and, test, ban, treaties, and, the, next, step, in, international, cooperation, should, be, the, abolition, of, nuclear, weapons, embryonic, stem, cell, research, is, against, god, 's, will, and, should, be, stopped, targeted,

because, it, lets, people, freely, speak, their, mind, without, consequence, we, should, support, collectivism, because, there, would, be, fewer, homeless, people, or, starving, people, if, people, of, means, took, a, community, interest, rather, than, one, of, pure, greed, as, people, age, they, tend, to, commit, less, crimes, keeping, individuals, in, jail, for, life, only, because, of, three,

screening, of, children, before, allowing, them, to, go, into, the, profession, we, should, not, legalize, prostitution, as, it, will, only, lead, to, more, people, trafficking, and, underage, people, being, lured, into, this, kind, of, work, as, people, seek, to, make, more, money, school, uniform, is, necessary, to, avoid, poor, students, to, feel, any, different, if, we, legalize, the, organ, trade, will, will, be, able, to, save, more, lives, and, keep, these, organs, out, of, the, hands, of, the, crime, network, subsidizing, embryonic, stem, cell, research, can, lead, to, forced, gathering, of, the, stem, cells, and, may, even, cause, worse, reactions, the, three, strikes, law, should, n't, be, abolished, because, by, having, the, law, it, keeps, repeat, offenders, in, prisons, and, gets, them, off, of, the, streets, targeted, killing, is, the, same, thing, as, murder, and, should, be, banned, we, should, support, collectivism, because, it, encourages, people, to, take, responsibility, for, their, community, which, eases, the, burden, on, the, state, we, should, prohibit, school, prayer, the, us, courts, have, consistently, ruled, that, it, is,

in, the, best, possible, candidates, private, militaries, are, a, threat, to, security, if, they, decide, to, overthrow, the, government, libertarianism, sounds, brilliant, as, a, theory, but, government, and, societies, require, rules, and, frameworks, to, function, and, abolishing, these, would, only, lead, to, chaos, without, knowing, the, long, term, effects, of, cloning, it, should, n't, be, attempted, on, humans, because, it, could, be, medically, problematic, legalizing, cannabis, as, far, as, health, is, concerned, can, be, beneficial, since, many, of, these, substances, are, used, as, treatments, for, certain, diseases, private, military, companies, protect, assests, and, officials, in, war, torn, areas, they, 're, needed, they, do, n't, take, money, from, the, tax,

all, the, people, truly, want, in, each, area, of, our, government, we, should,   , abolish, the, three, strikes, laws, because, they, can, put, people, away, for, minor, crimes, everyone, has, a, right, to, chose, a, religion, to, follow, no, matter, what, their, beliefs, practices, are, it, is, wrong, to, ban, a, religion, pride, parades, can, be, perceived, as, a, way, of, pushing, one, 's, views, on, other, 's, that, do, not, share, the, same, belifs, and, accepatances, capital, punishment, is, useless, imprisonment, is, actually, way, better, since, criminal, court, could, incarcerate, innocent, people, while, drone, strikes, are, effective, tools, there, is, still, a, significant, risk, of, non, combatant, casualties, due, to, the, distance, between, target, and, operator, and, lack, of, human, eyes, on, the, ground, an, austerity, regime, allows, us, to, save, money, when, it, is, needed, factory, farming, is, needed, in, our, times, in, order, to, provide, ample, food, for, everyone, journalism, can, not, be, unbiased, with, subsidization, surgery, can, be, dangerous, and, must, never, be, undertaken, without, a, medical, need, minors, also, do, not, need, to, be, told, there, is, something, wrong, about, them, that, needs, fixing, i, think, this, is, political, correctness, going, too, far.it, is, overkill.what, do, we, call, man, hole, covers?person, hole, covers, through, faith, missionaries, are, able, to, develop, deep, relationships, with, the, communities, they, serve, and, help, bring, much, needed, social, change, to, third, world, countries, compulsory, voting, will, cause, more, people, to, take, an, interest, in, politics, which, in, turn, will, benefit, everyone, if, any, one, state, were, to, abolish, nuclear, weapons, it, would, immediately, become, vulnerable, to, another, nuclear, power, thus, the, government, should, not, abolish, nuclear, weapons, in, order, to, fulfill, its, duty, to, protect, its, people, we, should, not, adopt, libertarianism, because, the, government, would, have, too, much, control, over, people, this, would, perhaps, help, with, our, countries, debt, crisis, olympic, games, cost, a, lot, of, money, for, the, host, city, to, organise, and, the, money, could, be, spent, better, elsewhere, if, people, want, to, go, to, college, they, need, to, work, hard, and, earn, enough, to, go, missionary, work, is, an, affront, to, people, 's, right, to, choose, their, own, religion, by, tying, aid, to, a, particular, religion, it, 's, no, different, than, imperialism, people, have, the, right, to, decide, for, themselves, what, they, want, to, eat, we, need, more, government, and, less, libertarianism, if, that, 's, what, makes, people, happy, then, they, should, be, allowed, to, do, it, it, would, lead, to, governments, better, reflecting, the, public, yes, i, think, that, we, should, ban, cosmetic, surgery, for, minors, because, in, not, fot, them, organ, sales, will, allow, for, more, research, to, be, done, on, living, usable, organs, embryonic, stem, cell, research, will, enable, us, to, make, major, breakthroughs, in, regards, to, the, prevention, and, treatment, of, diseases, minors, are, not, mature, enough, to, make, these, decisions, as, long, as, they, have, parental, permission, children, should, be, allowed, to, improve, their, physical, appearance, atheism, should, not, be, adopted, as, it, would, be, offensive, to, various, religious, groups, we, should, prohibit, this, because, it, affects, the, development, and, normal, behavior, of, children, private, military, companies, allow, people, with, money, to, hire, their, own, armies, to, force, others, to, do, what, they, want, military, forces, should, only, be, allowed, at, national, level, we, should, not, subsidize, wikipedia, because, the, government, should, spend, the, money, for, more, useful, things, if, abolished, it, will, stiffle, creativity, and, advancement, because, there, will, be, no, incentive, if, intellectual, property, is, not, a, right, autonomous, cars, eliminate, the, hazards, of, driving, distracted, and, drunk, driving,   , removing, these, hazards, from, our, roadways, will, make, us, all, safer, since, algorithmic, trading, is, all, computer, based, it, opens, a, door, for, hackers, to, infiltrate, and, corrupt, trading, platforms, some, people, have, committed, such, unspeakable, crimes, that, they, do, n't, deserve, to, live, we, should, not, ban, factory, farming, because, it, gives, us, another, source, of, food, this, is, a, horrible, way, to, treat, animals, they, should, not, be, caged, in, tiny, areas, unable, to, move, this, is, cruel, school, prayer, provides, a, quiet, moment, of, contemplation, for, students, in, a, busy, world, and, teaches, them, the, power, of, prayer, and, trust, adopting, an, austerity, regime, may, negatively, impact, the, demand, side, of, the, economy, hampering, economic, growth, legalizing, prostitution, would, be, the, thin, end, of, a, wedge, all, sorts, of, unsavoury, activities, are, centered, around, the, sex, industry, this, would, ensure, everyone, got, punished, if, they, broke, a, rule, minors, do, n't, understand, the, implications, of, their, choices, zero, tolerance, policies, remove, troublemakers, from, schools, before, they, become, an, even, larger, problem, which, improves, the, learning, environment, for, other, students, state, sponsored, killing, should, never, be, sanctioned, because, it, leads, down, the, path, of, extra, legal, activities, by, the, state, whenever, it, can, be, justified, we, should, adopt, a, multi, party, system, because, it, makes, it, so, that, there, is, naturally, more, of, a, choice, algorithmic, trading, enables, trades, to, be, made, without, spikes, of, emotion, or, rage, on, the, part, of, the, trader, therefore, it, can, only, be, seen, as, positive, if, people, are, habitually, re, offending, then, they, need, a, punishment, that, will, stop, them, a, mandatory, prison, sentence, is, the, minimum, they, should, have, as, a, punishment, we, should, not, legalize, prostitution, because, people, should, only, be, with, one, other, person, in, a, marriage, relationship, we, should, n't, ban, whaling, because, people, living, in, poverty, filled, countries, rely, on, whaling, as, there, only, source, of, food, autonomous, cars, will, always, have, the, possibility, to, glitch, out, like, any, other, computer, however, in, this, instance, the, consequences, are, much, more, severe, school, prayer, does, not, adhere, to, children, of, varying, religions, forcing, them, to, participate, or, feel, left, out, due, to, their, differing, beliefs, cannabis, should, be, legalized, with, the, same, limitations, as, alcohol, we, should, adopt, a, zero, tolerance, policy, in, schools, then, all, the, children, will, more, likely, behave, three, strike, laws, take, habitual, offenders, off, the, street, reducing, overall, crime, judicial, activism, is, the, only, way, to, maintain, control, mental, health, is, important, now, a, days, more, than, ever, before, with, how, society,

their, organs, not, realizing, they, will, need, it, when, they, get, older, school, uniforms, makes, sure, bullying, and, kids, getting, picked, on, is, kept, at, a, minimum, we, should, ban, fast, food, because, the, majority, of, it, is, not, of, nutritional, value, to, the, body, by, being, filled, with, chemicals, and, carbohydrates, child, actors, are, all, too, often, traumatised, or, abused, so, their, use, should, be, banned, people, can, make, a, living, from, prostitution, older, workers,   , provide, maturity, and, experience, and, can, be, loyal, and, productive, employees,

wrong, like, other, churches, the, church, of, scientology, needs, to, be, protected, via, the, separation, of, church, and, state, an, austerity, regime, would, stabilize, our, government, telemarkerting, provides, much, needed,   , jobs, to, people, without, other, skill, sets, zoos, keeping, animals, in, cages, while, all, animals, should, be, free, and, to, live, in, nature, an, effective, measure, to, avoid, bullying, is, to, adopt, zero, tolerance, and, more, severe, punishments, cosmetic, surgery, other, than, for, disfigurments, should, be, banned,   , society, puts, too, much, pressure, on, people, to, look, perfect,   , people, should, embrace, individuality, zero, tolerance, policies, have, been, shown, to, be, disproportionately, applied, to, minority, students,

of, expression, particularly, if, they, otherwise, wear, religious, garb, we, should, not, spend, a, fortune, on, the, richest, of, the, rich, it, is, unnecessary, and, elitist, executives, make, a, huge, salary, so, their, total, compensation, should, be, limited, in, order, to, allow, for, better, pay, for, the, lower, levels, of, employees, in, their, organizations, journalism, is, dead, as, many, new, outlets, are, heavily, biased, and, strive, for, sensational, news, rather, than, accurate, news, compulsory, voting, could, improve, peoples, knowledge, of, politics, if, they, knew, they, had, to, vote, they, might, learn, more, about, politics, we, should, abolish, the, olympic, games, because, the, money, they, spend, could, be, used, for, better, things, like, medical, research,

their, creation, would, be, diluted, by, copycats, we, should, abolish, zoos, because, the, animals, are, kept, in, such, small, enclosures, and, have, hardly, any, room, to, move, around, targeted,

therefore, we, can, not, impose, atheism, fast, food, is, bad, for, one, 's, health, and, should, be, banned, testing, of, nuclear, weapons, causes, pollution, and, destruction, judicial, activism, should, n't, be, limited, because, it, allows, judges, to, rule, in, favor, of, the, right, thing, regardless, if, the, current, laws, are, obstructing, said, behavior, this, is, essential, for, democracy, the, olympic, games, are, no, longer, relevant,   , they, focus, on, the, athletic, and, competitive, nature, of, humanity,   , we, must, instead, focus, on, the, intellectual, and, collaborative, aspects, to, solve, humanity, 's, problems, three, strike, offenders, are, habitual, criminals, and, should, be, treated, as, such, abolishing, nuclear, weapons, is, a, good, action, to, take, nuclear, weapons, are, dangerous, and, could, expose, the, planets, to, extreme, destruction, we, should, not, adopt, libertarianism, because, that, would, be, forcing, a, way, of, life, on, people, that, do, n't, want, it, the, country, needs, to, be, prepared, against, other, countries, that, use, space, exploration, to, advance, both, offensive, and, defensive, strategies, it, is, necessary, to, eliminate, the, church, of, scientology, for, the, safety, of, people, capital, punishment, helps, keep, murderers, from, ever, leaving, prison, can, lead, to, many, medical, breakthroughs, that, may, help, cure, and, or, treat, many, different, disease, we, should, adopt, gender, neutral, language, to, make, sure, everyone, is, included, the, way, they, want, to, be, identified, without, further, testing, and, experimentation, the, outcome, of, human, cloning, will, never, be, known, so, should, not, be, banned, if, the, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, was, abolished, people, would, be, unable, to, protect, themselves, and, their, property, atheism, allows, for, an, even, playing, field, removes, the, fighting, over, which, religion, is, superior, over, another, we, should, change, how, people, treat, others, rather, than, make, safe, spaces, there, is, no, benefit, to, whaling, it, is, bloody, and, barbaric, they, are, a, great, way, to, maintain, peace, when, the, are, used, as, a, deterrent, to, obtain, embryonic, stem, cells, the, early, embryo, has, to, be, destroyed, this, means, destroying, a, potential, human, life, factory, farming, is, an, efficient, way, of, providing, affordable, for, for, people, without, it, the, price, of, meat, will, escalate, and, will, be, beyond, the, pocket, of, many, people, we, should, not, prohibit, school, prayer, because, this, country, was, founded, and, based, on, the, christian, belief, system, we, are, a, nation, founded, on, christianity, so, atheism, goes, against, our, natural, beginnings, the, school, uniform, makes, everyone, equal, and, increases, learning, cosmetic, surgery, for, minors, should, be, banned, because, the, risks, involved, outweigh, any, benefit, that, may, be, acheived, legalizing, prostitution, will, increase, the, number, of, women, who, enter, into, this, degrading, profession, we, should, not, ban, telemarketing,   , since, it, would, eliminate, many, jobs, it, also, is, an, effective, way, for, a, company, to, get, much, needed, leads, for, their, products, or, services, if, done, correctly, we, should, abolish, intellectual, property, rights, because, the, rich, take, advantage, of, the, poor, prayer, in, school, should, n't, be, prohibited, because, it, could, result, in, many, social, benefits, the, government, should, not, outlaw, safe, procedures, that, can, be, done, to, the, body, they, are, more, of, a, detterrant, than, a, threat, at, this, stage, some, groups, are, still, subject, to, violence, and, mockery, and, they, should, have, a, place, to, access, to, get, away, from, that, this, could, save, and, enhance, many, lives, that, are, already, here, living, why, should, people, needlessly, suffer, when, answers, could, be, found, yet, mostly, looked, down, upon, because, of, biblical, reasons, the, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, should, not, be, abolished, because, it, allows, people, to, defend, themselves, missionary, work, has, other, benefits, beyond, spreading, religion, it, makes, a, huge, impact, on, small, communities, in, poor, countries, that, need, help, collectivism, requires, too, much, individual, compromise, this, would, provide, more, choices, and, let, us, see, more, points, of, view, it, is, cruel, and, really, is, not, necessary, libertarianism, is, wrong, and, will, deploy, mess, and, confuse, to, our, society, we, need, to, subsidize, journalism, so, that, it, continues, to, draw, in, good, people, if, people, are, proud, of, their, religion, and, want, to, travel, and, spread, the, word, they, should, be, able, to, freely, first, amendment, rights, no, belief, or, religion, should, be, instituted, in, a, blanket, form, people, are, completely, different, with, very, different, beliefs, no, one, way, is, good, for, everyone, there, should, be, freedom, to, believe, whatever, one, wants, it, would, bring, easier, access, to, those, in, need, of, organs, better, regulation, oversight, legalizing, organ, trade, will, cause, organs, to, go, to, the, highest, bidder, rather, than, to, those, most, in, need, prostitution, preys, on, vulnerable, workers, many, of, which, are, provided, through, human, trafficking, minors, are, still, growing, and, developing, cosmetic, surgery, at, such, a, young, age, is, pointless, as, features, are, still, naturally, changing, if, a, person, has, been, arrested, for, three, crimes, they, have, not, learned, from, their, mistakes, but, see, being, a, criminal, as, a, lifestyle,    , let, 's, put, those, people, behind, bars, and, prevent, more, crimes, economic, sanctions, usually, do, not, prove, to, be, effective, and, tend, to, cause, hard, feelings, between, the, countries, involved, subsidizing, journalism, will, create, biased, reporting, many, people, are, uninformed, about, the, issues, and, we, are, better, off, with, them, not, voting, we, need, to, make, it, more, accessible, for, the, public, to, acquire, education, as, opposed, to, adding, more, barriers, such, as, extreme, student, debt, marijuana, is, part, of, drug, culture, so, using, it, leads, to, other, much, more, dangerous, drug, use, we, should, not, ban, human, cloning, because, the, potential, scientists, can, find, a, cure, for, a, disease, canceling, pride, parades, will, be, supportive, to, all, of, us, who, think, that, the, only, marriage, which, should, be, followed, is, between, man, and, women, if, it, helps, us, understand, and, support, them, why, not, economic, sanctions, do, n't, work, and, result, to, have, enemies, abroad, capital, punishment, should, absolutely, be, abolished, because, it, is, inhumane, to, kill, a, person, no, matter, how, badly, they, behave, an, eye, for, an, eye, makes, the, whole, world, blind, cannabis, has, been, shown, to, negatively, affect, the, brain, causing, psychosis, and, paranoia, and, should, continue, to, be, controlled, the, damage, that, psychologically, causes, the, animals, to, be, enclosed, and, outside, their, natural, habitat, is, such, that, they, should, close, the, zoos, sex, selection, would, allow, the, ability, to, balance, the, gender, gap, allowing, for, an, even, capability, to, increase, the, population, reproductively, we, do, n't, subsidize, other, fields, so, why, should, we, subsidize, journalism, we, do, n't, have, heterosexual, pride, day, parades, so, why, should, we, have, pride, parades, cosmetic, surgery, is,   , putting, people, 's, lives, at, risk, so, we, should, really, ban, it, we, should, not, because, people, who, are, born, with, disfigurements, have, a, chance, to, be, normal, judicial, activism, enables,   , judges, to, override, any, law, that, exists, which, means, new, rules, will, be, created, and, the, existent, laws, might, not, be, followed, we, should, abolish, the, three, strikes, laws, because, the, punishment, is, just, enough, for, their, convictions, and, no, need, to, add, more, another, years, we, should, do, because, it, may, be, able, to, cure, diseases, we, never, thought, possible, and, help, people, have, babies, that, might, of, been, infertile, autonomous, cars, can, be, easily, hacked, to, cause, widespread, accidents, fighting, for, the, abolition, of, nuclear, weapons, is, useless, some, of, it, is, in, the, hands, of, very, dangerous, people, in, totalitarian, countries, which, will, not, obey, that, demand, gender, neutral, language, is, a, way, to, go, for, a, peaceful, community, fast, food, is, high, in, calories, and, causes, obsesity, capital, punishment, creates, space, for, potential, rehabilitation, without, prison, over, population, economic, sanctions, rarely, hurt, those, who, they, are, aimed, at, the, leaders, of, nations, instead, hurt, the, people, in, those, countries, who, can, least, afford, it, space, exploration, need, only, be, done, by, the, private, sector, developments, in, science, and, technology, have, been, accomplished, through, space, exploration, economic, sanctions, have, a, measurable, impact, if, that, impact, is, severe, enough, otherwise, reluctant, parties, may, agree, to, negotiations, in, order, to, find, relief, an, austerity, regime, is, the, most, effective, weapon, in, our, arsenal, to, combat, the, economic, issues, we, 're, facing, cosmetic, surgery, is, vital, for, people, like, burn, victims, to, heal, and, feel, more, normal, we, should, not, subsidize, journalism, because, it, acts, to, protect, poorly, run, and, inefficent, media, companies, from, normal, market, forces, the, technology, we, get, from, space, exploration, alone, is, worth, the, cost, of, it, mandatory, retirement, amounts, to, age, discrimination, and, can, leave, those, who, are, forced, to, retire, without, the, sense, of, purpose, that, work, could, bring, private, military, companies, are, more, efficient, than, government, run, this, practice, insures, students, are, all, equal, in, dress, and, ensures, students, will, not, come, to, school, in, inappropriate, clothing, adopting, now, an, austerity, regime, will, help, future, generations, to, cope, with, the, limited,   , resources,   , we, have, the, country, only, has, a, certain, amount, of, money, and, it, would, be, used, better, to, help, people, here, on, earth, than, to, explore, space, algorithmic, trading, is, the, future, of, investing, and, can, lead, to, a, more, prosperous, economy, in, the, long, run, collectivism, is, a, way, to, keep, people, in, line, and, following, the, group, whaling, will, threaten, to, endanger, many, species, of, whale, private, military, companies, are, mercenaries, who, can, harm, our, society, for, greed, and, we, do, n't, need, them, we, should, not, limit, judicial, activism, because, it, is, an, important, check, and, balance, on, the, legislative, and, executive, arms, of, government, a, multi, party, system,

physically, weaker, cannabis, provides, many, benefits, including, soothing, the, pain, of, people, that, are, ill,   , the, fact, that, it, is, still, illegal, is, outdated, and, should, be, changed, we, should, not, abolish, the, three, strikes, laws, because, they, result, in, reduced, crime, rates, judges, should, not, let, their, biases, come, into, play, when, making, judicial, decisions,

would, create, a, market, where, people, could, be, murdered, for, their, organs, to, help, a, wealthy, person, organ, sale, would, prey, on, the, poor, for, the, benefit, of, the, wealthy, we,

people, with, jobs, an, austerity, regime, will, only, cause, a, small, benefit, for, a, small, time, and, should, not, be, utilized, at, this, time, three, strikes, laws, can, act, as, a, deterrent, for, serial, criminal, behavior, executive, compensation, provides, incentive, for, people, to, take, on, high, responsibliity, positions, that, drive, the, economy, to, new, heights, creating, even, more, wealth, capital, punishment, is, just, another, way, to, oppress, and, control, minorities, and, certain, groups, which, undermine, the, mainstreem, perceptions, cosmetic, surgery, for, minors, makes, children, believe, that, aesthetics, are, more, important, than, who, they, are, on, the, inside, and, should, be, banned, we, should, n't, abolish, the, olympic, games, because, is, important,

it, 's, most, suited, for, them, so, we, can, not, impose, atheism, the, risk, of, giving, an, organ, or, even, part, of, an, organ, is, very, high, it, is, a, gateway, drug, and, we, do, n't, want, to, encourage, people, to, go, down, this, dangerous, path, space, exploration, is, important, for, the, development, and, growth, of, human, society, and, knowledge, and, should, be, invested, in,

negatively, affect, the, health, of, farm, workers, with, stories, of, tuberculous, spreading, from, animal, to, human, capital, punishment, is, barbaric, ties, up, a, lot, of, resources, and, does, n't, really, act, as, a, deterrent, to, major, crimes, the, government, is, putting, us, more, and, more, into, debt, with, wasteful, spending, and, no, real, boundaries, to, it, being, forced, to, do, anything, inhibits, freedom, pride, parades, are, important, for, gay, people, and, allow, them, to, get, their, message, across, to, the, wider, community, zoos, are, inhumane, structures, built, to, house, animals, away, from, their, natural, environment, zoos,   , should, be, abolished, and, animals, returned, to, their, natural, homes, where, they, can, be, free, we, should, ban, private, military, companies, as, they, are, not, trained, and, subject, to, the, same, scrutiny, as, the, military, pride, parades, are, entertaining, and, demonstrate, that, everybody, is, equal, regardless, of, their, sexuality, we, should, ban, fast, food, because, it, is, not, good, for, people, 's, health, and, they, are, very, unhealthy, in, terms, of, calories, safe, spaces, help, protect, all, people, private, military, companies, are, trained, for, combat, and, can, assist, the, governmental, military, groups, forcing, people, to, vote, will, cause, an, unwanted, outcome, in, elections, having, no, vote, is, as, much, speech, as, voting, compulsory, voting, makes, the, population, more, involved, in, the, election, process, and, would, give, results, that, more, accurately, reflected, the, will, of, the, electors, mandatory, retirement, ensures, there, are, places, in, the, workplace, for, those, who, are, starting, their, careers, whaling, is, a, tradition, with, some, native, groups, and, they, need, the, meat, to, survive, through, winter, mandatory, retirement, is, unfair, to, people, who, need, a, job, when, social, security, can, not, pay, the, bills, the, national, debt, is, out, of, control, and, we, can, not, afford, to, add, to, it, further, the, threat, of, nuclear, weapons, can, keep, bad, actors, from, doing,   , great, damage, legalizing, organ, trade, would, add, a, level, of, scrutiny, and, regulation, that, would, make, it, much, safer, for, all, involved, women, are, going, to, sell, their, bodies, so, why, not, make, it, legal, so, they, can, do, it, properly, pay, taxes, on, their, income, and, hopefully, stay, clean, child, actors, are, put, through, too, much, at, too, young,   , we, should, do, away, with, them, and, just, use, cgi, or, something, like, that,   , if, a, big, company, can, call, a, cgi, movie, live, action, and, get, away, with, it, it, will, work, we, should, abolish, zoos, because, it, makes, animals, prisoners, we, should, not, abolish, safe, spaces, because, sometimes, limits, on, certain, types, of, speech, are, necessary, to, preserve, other, types, of, speech, we, should, not, subsidize, embryonic, stem, cell, research, because, doing, so, would, force, millions, to, pay, taxes, on, such, when, it, 's, highly, against, their, religions, we, should, not, oppose, this, because, groups, are, what, make, society, and, should, be, recognised, all, together, economic, sanctions, are, a, good, way, to, get, things, to, happen, in, a, target, area, it, takes, away, the, human, component, and, machines, can, easily, make, mistakes, a, zero, tolerance, policy, in, schools, is, the, wrong, way, to, go, as, it, would, too, often, cause, innocent, students, being, punished, for, being, pushed, too, far, the, church, uses, slave, labor, and, other, intimidation, tactics, to, get, what, they, want, there, are, two, genders, and, it, is, not, offensive, to, use, those, two, descriptions, when, talking, about, people, it, is, ridiculous, to, attempt, to, include, every, possible, gender, identity, wikipedia, does, not, need, to, be, subsidized, it, already, gets, plenty, of, cash, from, donations, a, zero, tolerance, policy, in, schools, would, cut, down, on, bullying, and, fighting, whaling, is, inhumane, and, also, contributes, to, the, dwindling, number, of, whales, in, existence, who, need, protection, rather, than, hunted, forcing, parents, to, buy, a, whole, separate, wardrobe, of, often, overpriced, synthetic, fiber, clothing, is, an, unnecessary, expense, that, can, really, harm, poorer, families, austerity, regimes, disproportionally, hit, the, poorest, in, society, hardest, adopting, atheism, infringes, upon, people, 's, first, amendment, right, to, freedom, of, religion, i, believe, we, should, adopt, an, austerity, regime, because, our, government, has, a, tremendous, debt, and, has, proven, over, time, that, they, are, not, capable, to, reducing, the, national, debt, factory, farming, is, not, good, for, the, environment, capital, punishment, is, good, at, keeping, dangerous, criminals, off, of, the, streets, whaling, disturbs, the, delicate, balance, of, sea, life, the, olympic, games, bring, peace, and, comeraderie, and, friendly, competition, to, the, entire, universe, we, should, n't, subsidize, space, exploration, because, it, can, be, very, costly, student, loans, should, be, subsidized, because, no, human, being, should, start, their, adult, life, off, with, thousands, of, dollars, in, debt, it, 's, not, fair, the, drive, around, cosmetic, surgery, and, body, modification, of, minor, should, be, nipped, in, the, bud, a, minor, should, be, concerned, about, academics, not, cosmetics, people, should, not, be, forced, to, be, in, uncomfortable, or, distasteful, situations, and, safe, spaces, provide, a, haven, from, this, fast, food, is, high, fat, and, unhealthy, food, zoos, are, cruel, and, contain, wild, animals, in, such, tiny, spaces, when, they, need, to, run, free, so, zoos, should, be, abolished, we, should, not, abolish, the, three, strikes, laws, in, all, cases, but, it, should, be, up, to, judicial, discretion, so, that, the, worst, criminal, are, off, the, streets, fast, food, is, nutritionally, devoid, cruel, to, animals, pollutes, the, environment, and, is, aggressively, marketed, towards, impressional, children, scientology, is, a, cult, we, need, to, end, cults, a, student, does, not, have, the, resources, to, pay, for, the, high, cost, of, college, they, enable, people, to, celebrate, their, sexuality, and, bring, the, culture, to, the, wider, general, public, a, multi, party, system, allows, for, a, broad, range, of, ideas, to, be, heard, and, implemented, plastic, surgery, is, a, life, altering, decision, and, should, not, be, taken, lightly, so, much, so, that, if, you, are, a, minor, you, should, not, be, allowed, to, get, it, wikipedia, is, an, important, resource, for, people, looking, for, information, we, should, ban, whaling, because, they, are, becoming, closer, to, being, extinct,   , no, animal, should, be, killed, when, there, is, not, an, abundance, of, their, species, cosmetic, surgery, is, taking, unnecessary, risks, less, and, less, people, are, voting, which, means, we, do, not, get, a, fair, representation, of, who, we, have, as, a, government, so, people, need, to, say, what, they, think, by, ridding, the, world, of, nuclear, weapons, we, do, not, have, to, worry, about, nuclear, accidents, or, mistakes, young, workers, wo, n't, be, able, to, find, a, job, if, no, one, ever, retires, it, would, stop, people, being, locked, up, for, possession, and, it, would, generate, revenue, we, should, not, ban, targeted, killing, as, this, is, an, effective, way, to, extinguish, terrorist, threats, etc, and, the, use, of, drones, helps, to, reduce, civilian, casualties, autonomous, cars, will, cause, unemployment, for, people, whose, only, skill, is, driving, zero, tolerance, parties, have, the, appearance, of, fairness, which, increases, buy, in, to, the, disciplinary, system, from, otherwise, skeptical, parents, and, community, leaders, the, more, research, that, is, done, the, higher, the, chances, to, understanding, and, possible, curing, diseases, we, should, abolish,   , because, it, changes, an, animals, behavior, versus, if, they, were, free, in, the, wild, removing, ip, rights, would, cause, a, free, for, all, and, no, one, will, have, the, incentive, to, do, anything, since, it, can, just, be, taken, by, someone, else, fair, and, honest, journalism, is, important, and, should, be, subsidized, for, the, benefit, of, all, children, should, be, free, to, have, fun, and, enjoy, life, not, made, to, work, in, hire, pressure, situations, so, we, should, ban, the, use, of, child, actors, to, keep, wikipedia, impartial, there, ought, to, be, no, subsidies, provided, legalizing, prostitution, encourages, the, objectification, of, female, bodies, which, encourages, sexual, harassment, and, commodification, there, are, much, more, important, things, to, spend, money, on, than, autonomous, cars, for, example, the, threats, posed, by, climate, change, and, the, pollution, of, our, oceans, sometimes, cosmetic, surgery, is, n't, so, much, cosmetic, as, it, is, therapeutic,   , it, offers, a, ray, of, hope, and, should, not, be, banned, the, use, without, measure, of, cannabis, harms, the, mental, health, of, the, people, therefore, it, is, necessary, that, the, intention, to, legalize, cannabis, be, eliminated, adopting, zero, tolerance, in, school, will, solve, the, big, issues, which, schools, all, around, country, face, it, today, we, have, a, separation, of, church, and, state, and, the, state, runs, the, public, schools, we, should, make, sex, selection, legal, it, will, lead, to, more, freedom, regarding, choices, of, family, building, a, couple, could, choose, to, have, a, boy, and, a, girl, without, just, hoping, for, that, scenario, safe, spaces, provide, safety, for, those, who, are, in, fear, for, their, safety, space, exploration, is, a, field, which, the, private, sector, is, fully, capable, to, fulfill, as, elon, musk, shows, us, missionaries, have, been, sent, in, the, past, to, the, poorest, communities, in, forein, countries, to, essentially, bribe, them, into, joining, a, religion, this, is, immoral, why, should, anyone, be, forced, to, vote?it, is, their, right, to, vote, or, not, to, vote, as, they, see, fit.it, is, not, a, democratic, system, to, force, people, to, do, this, i, do, n't, think, that, is, a, good, idea, to, ban, telemarketing, there, are, people, working, in, this, kind, of, jobs, and, they, are, good, at, what, they, do, most, of, the, time, they, advertise, very, well, we, have, freedom, of, religion, for, a, reason, and, banning, any, religion, is, wrong, gender, neutral, language, is, political, correctness, taken, to, an, absurd, degree, there, is, no, need, to, reinvent, words, and, language, for, the, sake, of, gender, equality, in, an, increasingly, open, society, we, should, stop, the, development, of, autonomous, cars, because, they, do, n't, have, reflexes, like, people, and, therefore, would, probably, not, be, able, to, prevent, accidents, like, people, can, the, church, of, scientology, should, have, the, same, rights, as, any, other, church, in,   , the, us, factory, farming, is, a, necessary, tactic, to, provide, the, food, resources, our, population, requires, it, does, not, need, to, be, cruel, it, can, merely, be, efficient, autonomous, cars, are, not, trustable, in, every, aspect, of, safety, we, ca, n't, trust, the, robots, and, their, ability, to, react, in, such, a, situation, which, humans, will, react, in, according, of, situation, whaling, is, carried, out, in, an, indiscrimate, and, inhumane, manner, driving, certain, species, to, the, brink, of, extinction, an, organ, trade, could, lead, to, exploitation, of, vulnerable, people, for, financial, gain, we, should, n't, give, money, to, a, site, where, anyone, can, edit, articles, to, give, false, information, libertarianism, should, be, adopted, as, it, will, give, more, freedom, to, people, to, live, their, lives, as, they, wish, executive, compensation, can, be, come, out, of, control, the, missionaries, bring, hope, and, the, word, of, god, to, those, people, forgotten, by, civilization, cosmetic, surgery, should, be, allowed, for, minor, because, they, may, need, surgery, from, an, accident, or, from, a, deformity, that, can, be, fixed, before, they, are, old, enough, to, suffer, from, it, we, need, to, feed, a, large, population, factory, farming, helps, ensure, we,   , can, do, that, to, be, able, to, provide, a, stable, economy, an, austerity, regime, is, necessary, to, operate, on, a, balanced, budget, we, should, adopt, an, austerity, regime, to, help, pay, the, country'd, unending, debt, minors, are, not, mature, enough, to, opt, for, cosmetic, surgery, and, there, is, concern, that, they, could, later, have, regrets, we, do, not, have, the, infrastructure, required, for, a, safe, autonomous, driving, system, how, can, we, code, the, car, to, choose, between, one, fatality, and, another, it, would, destroy, the, taxi, and, delivery, driver, job, market, factory, farming, concentrates, animals, in, a, constricted, area, allowing, diseases, to, run, rampant, through, the, livestock, the, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, is, fundamental, to, our, freedom,   , we, give, that, right, up, and, we, are, prisoners, to, the, government, pride, parades, may, help, overcome, prejudice, and, cultural, barriers, they, are, what, we, need, to, start, educating, future, generations, multi, party, systems, are, proven, around, the, world, to, work, better, wider, availability, of, student, loans, creates, a, glut, of, over, educated, under, employed, individuals, contributing, less, to, society, money, would, be, better, investing, in, vocational, education, a, zero, tolerance, policy, in, school, would, improve, behaviour, and, thus, improve, results, we, should, not, ban, private, military, companies, because, they, can, provide, great, protection, in, many, areas, of, our, country, missionary, work, is, important, because, it, gives, aid, to, third, world, and, poor, people, that, might, otherwise, be, ignored, by, society, child, actors, do, not, get, a, proper, education, and, as, such, the, use, of, child, actors, should, be, banned, being, permissive, of, disruptive, behavior, is, unfair, to, well, behaved, students, collectivism, allows, for, the, group, mentality, and, act, to, provide, a, better, quality, of, life, equal, for, the, people, in, a, collective, government, the, theory, of, mutual, assured, destruction, is, viable, today, as, much, as, it, was, in, the, cold, war, and, the, result, is, relative, peace, people, who, have, no, clue, about, the, issues, and, people, who, are, not, into, politics, would, be, voting, for, someone, they, know, nothing, about, atheism, gives, everyone, a, clean, slate, of, non, belief, we, should, support, collectivism, because, people, have, more, freedom, when, they, are, supported, in, their, choices, than, when, they, have, to, scramble, for, everything, on, their, own, the, olympic, games, has, become, less, about, the, sports, and, more, about, commercialism, a, lot, of, private, resources, are, needed, for, military, campaigns, such, as, weapon, manufacture, using, a, private, military, company, is, no, different, factory, agriculture, can, cause, disasters, in, the, economy, and, cause, unfair, competition, with, farmers, abolishing, the, right, to, keep, and, bear, arms, would, put, all, innocent, people, at, risk, because, people, who, want, to, kill, will, find, a, way, to, do, so, and, innocent, people, will, be, defenseless, only, the, federal, government, should, be, allowed, to, handle, any, military, training, compulsory, voting, would, make, sure, that, each, and, every, person, 's, voice, is, heard, and, provide, a, more, accurate, system, of, making, sure, the, person, elected, is, the, one, the, people, really, want, space, mining, could, help, us, find, valuable, minerals, that, are, useful, we, do, n't, know, what, the, source, of, embryonic, stem, cells, is, for, all, we, know, they, could, be, paid, for, or, harvested, from, unsuspecting, individuals, judicial, activism, may, lead, to, despotic, behavior, therefore,   , we, should, avoid, it, economic, sanctions, help, end, bad, behaviors, subsidizing, journalism, will, allow, individual, journals, to, lift, their, paywalls, which, will, increase, access, we, should, not, put, up, barriers, to, what, is, essentially, the, application, of, technology, and, intelligent, application, of, maths, to, trading, this, prevents, progression, legalizing, prostitution, would, lead, to, it, being, more, regulated, therefore, safer, to, any, participants, olympic, games, often, make, unnecessary, expenses, that, could, be, used, for, other, causes, autonomous, cars, will, be, highly, beneficial, in, reducing, the, congestion, of, larger, cities, we, should, ban, cosmetic, surgery, because, doctors, should, spend, their, time, helping, people, that, need, it, not, the, people, that, want, it, by, allowing, citizens, to, own, guns, the, chances, of, these, weapons, being, stolen, by, criminals, is, increased, allowing, guns, to, fall, into, the, wrong, hands, would, be, disastrous, the, organ, trade, should, not, be, legalized, as, it, encourages, the, expoitationn, of, poor, people, by, rich, people, compulsory, voting, would, ensure, that, everyone, would, vote, and, have, a, voice, in, what, goes, on, we, should, not, because, it, would, cost, the, country, millions, of, pounds, and, raise, everyone, 's, taxes, so, the, cost, of, living, would, go, up, freedom, of, religion, should, be, considered, first, and, foremost, even, for, minors, if, the, government, provides, funding, to, wikipedia, the, impartiality, and, therefore, reliability, of, the, information, held, on, there, may, be, compromised, we, need, to, support, price, parades, because, everyone, has, the, right, to, celebrate, their, cultures, and, diversities, prostitution, is, a, noble, work, for, women, finding, it, hard, to, secure, a, job, in, this, world, becoming, more, and, more, hard, and, difficult, we, should, ban, fast, food, as, its, unhealthy, and, can, cause, sedentary, lifestyles, and, cardiovascular, disease, sex, selection, is, simply, a, matter, of, choice, and, bodily, autonomy,   , every,

that, are, never, used, again, whaling, is, causing, the, depletion, of, the, whale, species,    , we, do, n't, need, to, lose, another, species, of, animal, on, the, planet, it, is, a, useful, site, but, no, need, to, subsidize, wikipedia, the, site, can, get, by, with, private, funding, like, it, has, all, these, years, and, besides, government, has, much, more, important, needs, to, subsidize, like, health, care, intellectual, property, rights, protects, the, ideas, that, will, lead, to, a, solid, invention, investment, and, therefore, need, to, be, protected, not, abolished, we, need, to, continue, to, explore, space, as, it, is, part, of, our, world, we, should, n't, adopt, atheism, because, it, can, scare, people, away, from, religion, libertarianism, provides, little, to, no, support, for,   , those, at, the, bottom, and, would, not, attain, equitable, outcomes, for, society, zoos, are, vital, for, research, into, species, and, preventing, their, extinction, and, should,

welfare, since, they, are, designed, to, make, money, for, their, owners, it, is, essentially, exploitation, under, the, guise, of, environmental, protection, legalizing, prostitution, would, result, in, an, increased, number, of, women, being, forced, into, sex, slavery, it, would, also, make, it, harder, to, hunt, down, traffickers, we, should, stop, the, development, of, autonomous, cars, because, they, wo, n't, be, able, to, react, in, some, emergency, situations, like, people, will, we, should, n't, legalize, cannabis, because, it, might, get, children, addicted, at, a, younger, age, if, it, 's, easier, to, acquire, legalizing, prostitution, will, allow, it, to, be, carried, out, in, a, safe, environment, judicial, activism, can, be, beneficial, in, some, cases, they, are, dangerous, and, give, countries, the, power, to, wipe, out, each, other, we, should, not, legalize, prostitution, it, is, not, right, for, women, or, men, to, make, a, living, by, having, sex, it, will, lead, to, a, society, in, which, marriages, fall, apart, and, children, are, harmed, in, the, process, mandatory, retirement, is, discrimination, against, older, people, who, may, still, have,

started, when, they, leave, school, everybody, has, a, right, to, believe, whatever, wants, so, church, of, scientology, should, be, protected, and, approved, we, want, to, have, an, inclusive, society, and, try, to, make, each, and, every, individual, feel, comfortable, students, who, are, suspended, will, loose, out, on, classes, and, might, fail, exams, or, even, drop, out, of, school, as, a, result, it, is, very, difficult, to, define, and, identify, and, intellectual, property, organ, trading, would, pressure, poor, people, to, take, great, risks, with, their, bodies, in,

and, should, not, be, acceptable, the, cost, of, training, new, employees, can, be, incredibly, high, and, policies, of, mandatory, retirement, force, businesses, to, waste, their, fungible, resources, rather, than, keeping, competent, older, individuals, employed, selecting, the, sex, of, babies, could, lead, to, an, in, balance, in, society, demonstrated, by, china, where, the, one,

should, get, a, bunch, extra, just, because, of, that, position, people, can, have, strong, feelings, about, which, sex, child, they, have, they, should, be, able, to, choose, for, themselves, and, not, have, to, rely, on, chance, it, send, the, wrong, message, to, society, that, drug, use, is, acceptable, people, should, be, given, a, choice, whether, they, would, like, to, vote, or, not, it, would, be, undemocratic, to, not, give, the, people, a, choice, telemarketing, is, still, a, useful, sales, tactic, we, should, adopt, a, zero, tolerance, policy, because, it, will, keep, kids, disciplined, and, the, schools, will, be, safer, human, cloning, is, unnatural, and, against, the, laws, of, nature, three, strikes, laws, are, a, major, reason, for, overcrowding, in, our, prison,

history, and, custom, we, should, not, prohibit, school, prayer, because, this, country, was, founded, on, christian, principals, school, uniform, makes, all, children, look, the, same, thus, reducing, bullying, gender, neutral, language, adheres, to, both, sexes, without, a, preference, of, one, gender, over, the, other, zoos, are, the, only, way, we, can, preserve, endangered, species, child, actors, are, needed, in, all, types, of, film, and, movies, and, therefore, should, not, be, banned, you, ca, n't, govern, what, an, individual, chooses, to, eat, space, exploration, is, a,

school, prayer, brings, people, together, in, fostering, an, atmosphere, of, peace, and, understanding, and, should, be, seen, as, a, message, of, universality, rather, than, an, appeal, to, a,

the, value, of, pension, funds, for, instance, some, children, may, require, cosmetic, surgery, for, health, reasons, such, as, a, cleft, palate, therefore, it, should, not, be, banned, legalizing, the, organ, trade, would, make, the, organs, to, expensive, to, all, those, on, need, making, them, available, to, only, the, wealthiest, of, patients, an, austerity, regime, is, very, important, during, economically, stressful, times, humans, need, food, and, this, is, simply, another, way, to, cultivate, it,   , at, the, end, of, the, day, these, animals, are, going, to, be, food, no,

can, have, an, enormous, impact, on, increasing, self, esteem, minors, should, be, allowed, to, benefit, from, this, as, well, animals, need, to, be, free, and, unrestricted, zoos, offer, small,

have, the, same, ideas, and, inspiration, atheists, are, much, more, likely, to, care, about, the, environment, zoos, are, helping, in, many, ways, the, animals, that, are, going, extinct, and, that, will, not, make, it, in, the, wild, so, they, should, not, be, abolished, embryonic, stem, cells, have, already, been, proven, to, have, the, capability, to, save, lives, with, more, research, who, knows, how, many, more, uses, they, could, have, in, reducing, illness, and, improving, quality, of, life, we, should, n't, ban, whaling, because, it, is, so, important, to, many, cultures, as, long, as, the, whales, are, sustainably, harvested, what, is, the, issue, journalism, is, incredibly, important, when, it, comes, to, unbiased, coverage, of, our, government, if, we, got, rid, of, three, strikes, laws, there, would, be, little, deterrent, for, career, criminals, an, austerity, regime, will, cause, taxpayers, to, have, to, pay, more, taxes, safe, spaces, are, an, enormous, waste, of, time, and, money, especially, when, things, like, churches, medical, offices, etc, exist, we, need, to, spend, money, on, people, who, are, already, alive, and, need, help, before, we, create, new, ones, we, should, cancel, pride, parades, because, it, is, not, needed, to, show, off, people, everything, what, they, wanted, whaling, is, not, just, cruel, but, an, indefensible, assault, on, endangered, species, military, contractors, take, work, away, from, our, own, troops, which, the, government, already, spends, a, great, deal, on, capital, punishment, has, done, nothing, to, actually, deter, serious, crime, in, this, country, if, people, do, not, learn, from, their, mistakes, and, corrections, then, they, are, unfit, to, live, among, society, an, owner, of, a, company, should, be, allowed, to, make, as, much, money, as, possible, nuclear, weapons, have, the, ability, to, destroy, the, entire, human, race, and, should, be, banned, safe, spaces, should, be, abolished, because, it, just, means, that, people, can, get, out, of, work, classes, etc, if, they, feel, unsafe, people, should, be, able, to, utilize, new, sciences, as, they, please, it, is, important, to, be, sensible, and, restrained, with, public, spending, and, ensure, that, a, country, lives, within, its, means, and, maintains, a, solid, balance, of, resources, minors, can, not, vote, drink, alcohol, drive, or, sign, up, for, military, service, so, why, should, we, allow, children, to, make, permanent, unnecessary, and, potentially, dangerous, alterations, to, their, bodies, subsidizing, student, loans, would, encourage, those, with, less, money, to, stay, on, in, education, rather, than, leaving, for, lower, paying, jobs, multi, party, systems, fragments, power, so, much, that, nothing, ever, gets, done, and, government, is, rendered, ineffectual, school, prayer, is, harmless, to, students, and, has, been, a, tradition, in, many, schools, and, should, be, allowed, to, continue, with, those, that, do, not, share, the, same, views, allowed, to, not, participate, we, should, legalize, prostitution, in, order, to, avoid, giving, young, people, criminal, records, that, will, hurt, their, job, prospects, down, the, line, freedom, of, religion, means, children, should, be, able, to, pray, where, they, want, to, atheism, offends, the, beliefs, of, most, people, no, one, should, be, forced, to, deny, their, belief, in, god, cosmetic, surgery, can, cause, medical, problems, in, the, long, run, safe, spaces, are, an, important, place, for, students, to, get, help, or, support, without, being, judged, there, is, no, reason, to, have, cosmetic, surgery, except, for, vainity, and, it, carries, risks, so, it, should, be, banned, in, places, where, capital, punishment, is, legal, it, is, often, used, in, discriminatory, ways, against, minority, groups, and, therefore, we, should, abolish, it, to, prevent, disproportionate, punishment, against, the, most, vulnerable, people, in, society, with, executive, compensation, a, person, is, more, likely, to, risk, the, viability, of, the, company, for, short, term, gains, thereby, hurting, people, at, the, bottom, a, multi, party, system, allows, for, more, ideas, more, candidates, more, voters, turning, out, private, military, companies, only, purpose, is, to, make, money, and, as, a, result, they, do, n't, focus, on, protection, as, much, as, they, should, be, if, someone, does, not, want, to, engage, with, telemarketers, they, can, just, hang, up, or, sign, off, student, loans, are, a, good, deal, for, students, student, loans, allow, for, some, students, go, to, school, that, may, have, not, been, able, to, go, to, school, before, we, should, ban, fast, food, because, obesity, the, biggest, health, crisis, in, the, country, cosmetic, surgery, increases, women, 's, self, esteem, and, makes, them, more, self, confident, cosmetic, surgery, is, a, form, of, self, expression, and, it, is, unfair, to, prevent, a, consenting, individual, from, partaking, nuclear, weapon, maintenance, is, much, cheaper, than, keeping, up, traditional, weapons, and, infrastructure, of, war, so, we, should, keep, our, nuclear, weapons, in, order, to, maintain, the, current, deterrence, against, war, at, the, lowest, price, possible, private, military, companies, are, largely, unregulated, and, providing, muscle, for, financial, gain, fosters, corruption, and, undemocratic, process, it, is, the, survival, of, the, powerful, over, the, poor, oppressed, we, should, not, ban, the, use, of, child, actors, because, it, would, be, awfully, strange, to, watch, programs, and, never, see, a, child, as, that, is, not, real, life, school, uniforms, should, not, be, required, to, wear, in, schools, because, it, takes, away, a, kids, freedom, of, expression, autonomous, cars, will, facilitate, long, commute, riding, we, should, ban, human, cloning, because, people, were, not, made, to, be, cloned, we, are, all, unique, and, individual, for, a, reason, often, females, prostitutes, are, vulnerable, and, have, drug, and, alcohol, problems, they, are, only, prostitutes, because, they, are, desperate,

there, are, cases, where, there, is, strong, doubt, that, the, person, executed, actually, carried, out, the, crime, we, should, not, adopt, atheism, because, in, this, country, it, 's, a, right, to,

this, are, generally, more, stable, collectivism, makes, people, lazy,   , why, work, hard, if, other, people, will, do, it, for, you,   , we, should, encourage, individualism, instead, where, people,

20, percent, of, the, population, that, gets, out, to, vote, cannabis, can, harm, brain, chemistry, in, children, we, need, to, find, a, way, for, the, government, to, pay, its, debt, there, is, an,

keep, capital, punishment, because, killers, do, nt, deserve, to, live, a, life, for, a, life, prostitution, leads, to, human, trafficing, with, todays, progression, it, only, makes, sense, then, we, wo, nt, insult, people, older, people, should, be, forced, to, retire, at, a, certain, age, because, the, world, is, steadily, changed, and, their, knowledge, becomes, outdated, people, are, guided, by, religion, on, how, to, conduct, their, live, and, its, been, around, for, thousands, of, years, algorithmic, trading, gives, an, unfair, advantage, to, traders, who, can, afford, the, best,

its, a, constitutional, right, we, ca, nt, just, take, that, away, from, people, we, should, not, abolish, the, three, strikes, laws, but, we, could, improve, them, so, that, people, who, have, committed, only, a, minor, offence, are, not, jailed, for, life, collectivism, ensures, that, everybody, is, taken, care, of, animals, in, zoos, are, miserable, and, confined, zoos, hold, animals, in,

go, to, colleges, that, we, beyond, their, means, legalizing, cannabis, may, cause, fewer, people, to, drink, and, smoke, cigarettes, which, will, lead, to, a, healthier, society, prostitution,

to, be, dangerous, to, the, missionaries, and, their, families, it, would, save, taxpayers, from, paying, for, a, person, to, have, a, room, and, food, for, the, rest, of, their, natural, life, if, that, s, their, sentence, cannabis, use, leads, to, the, use, of, other, drugs, just, as, those, who, wish, not, to, pray, the, ones, that, want, to, pray, should, have, that, option, targeted,

help, in, term, of, educations, health, and, spiritual, needs, due, to, the, obligations, of, the, students, it, is, sometimes, difficult, to, get, a, job, we, must, help, them, pay, their, loans, so, that, they, do, not, leave, school, targeted, killing, can, help, remove, terrorist, and, other, similar, threats, without, having, to, involve, large, numbers, of, people, targeted, killing, can,

should, be, like, this, we, should, ban, the, church, of, scientology, because,   , scientologists, become, hostile, toward, anything, that, is, critical, toward, the, religion, we, should, not, adopt, an, austerity, regime, because, it, will, affect, the, general, populations, tremendously, severe, recession, and, many, other, problems, journalism, should, not, be, subsidized, because, subsidies, could, too, easily, be, allotted, according, to, political, beliefs, economic, sanctions, provide, security, and, ensure, that, citizens, are, treated, fairly, telemarketing, is, an, invasive, nuisance, and, is, a, platform, for, many, types, of, fraud, having, a, mastectomy, is, devastating, to, many, women, and, having, the, chance, to, look, normal, again, is, needed, in, society, there, needs, to, be, places, where, in, the, world, where, bias, and, recrimination, does, not, exist, people, need, a, safe, space, so, they, are, not, bothered, by, prejudice, and, bias, missionary, work, does, not, cause, any, harm, as, long, as, proper, education, is, present, on, both, sides, the, three, strikes, law,   , should, be, abolished, and, the, punishment, should, always, fit, the, crime, so, if, the, third, crime, is, petty, then, they, should, have, a, minimal, sentence, or, fine, rather, than, prison, terms, having, school, uniforms, does, n't, infringe, on, free, speech, since, students, can, exercise, that, right, in, other, ways, capital, punishment, is, more, humane, than, other, extreme, punishment, like, permanent, solitary, confinement, or, guard, abuse, since, prison, 's, radicalize, more, than, they, rehabilitate, three, strikes, laws, end, up, creating, more, re, offenders, by, putting, people, away, for, longer, in, an, environment, that, radicalizes, them, the, money, used, on, space, exploration, could, be, used, on, alternative, initiatives, such, as, an, health, and, combating, poverty, in, a, fast, paced, society, a, quick, meal, is, a, blessing, journalism, should, be, subject, to, the, same, market, forces, as, everything, else, libertarianism, reduces, the, oppression, of, big, government, and, gives, more, freedom, to, the, pople, we, should, because, we, can, still, learn, so, much, about, space, cosmetic, surgery, is, important, for, health, issues, such, as, people, who, have, been, born, with, a, cleft, palate, organ, trade, would, help, save, thousands, of, lives, every, year, we, should, legalize, prostitution, because, freedom, should, be, absolute, if, i, wish, to, make, money, having, sex, i, should, have, that, right, having, it, legal, will, reduce, the, violence, and, increase, safety, people, should, be, allowed, to, choose, how, to, believe, freely, and, not, forced, to, accept, the, beliefs, of, atheism,   , each, person, has, a, mind, and, can, make, their, own, decision, and, should, be, allowed, the, freedom, of, choice, whaling, is, profitable, for, the, people, that, do, it, and, would, result, in, a, loss, of, income, and, tradition, some, animals, would, be, extinct, if, it, were, n't, for, zoos, we, should, not, support, the, austerity, regime, because, it, takes, away, from, programs, that, are, most, needed, such, as, feeding, children, adopting, a, zero, tolerance, policy, helps, to, combat, violence, and, drug, abuse, in, schools, autonomous, cars,   , are, the, future, of, road, transport, and, can, help, people, drive, in, a, safer, way, and, even, relaxing, while, using, them, people, have, the, right, to, live, their, lives, in, any, way, they, choose, and, the, government, does, n't, have, the, right, to, tell, adults, what, they, can, put, in, their, own, bodies, small, harmless, cosmetic, surgeries, can, do, a, lot, for, increasing, a, child, 's, confidence, and, productivity, subsidizing, student, loans, would, allow, access, to, funds, above, the, means, of, the, student, and, the, financial, consequences, in, the, future, including, higher, interest, rates, would, be, financially, detrimental, wikipedia, is, a, very, unreliable, source, of, information, many, schools, do, not, allow, wikipedia, to, be, used, as, a, valid, source, for, term, papers, zoos, are, places, that, protect, and, breed, animals, that, would, otherwise, become, extinct, due, to, the, inactive, lifestyle, and, stressful, lives, many, people, are, getting, lifestyle, diseases, such, as, diabetes, hypertension, etc, fit, india, movement, can, encourage, people, to, consume, healthy, food, and, maintain, physical, and, mental, fitness, with, high, quality, advertisements, and, marketing, practices, junk, food, manufacturers, are, manipulating, children, to, buy, their, foods, this, fit, india, movement, will, make, children, think, about, the, negative, consequences, of, junk, food, as, a, result, this, movement, will, encourage, children, to, consume, healthy, food, some, parents, put, too, much, stress, on, children, to, study, they, send, their, children, to, tuition, after, school, or, just, make, them, sit, to, do, homework, forgetting, the, importance, of, free, time, to, play, this, movement, has, the, potential, to, change, their, minds, and, as, a, result, they, may, encourage, their, children, to, go, out, and, play, this, movement, has, the, potential, to, make, more, people, embrace, traditional, indian, martial, art, forms, like, kathi, samu, musti, yudha, etc, and, traditional, dance, forms, and, also, healthy, indian, snacks, and, as, a, byproduct, this, may, result, in, creating, some, jobs, the, motivation, to, maintain, fitness, should, start, from, childhood, but, in, india, many, schools, lack, playgrounds, lack, of, playgrounds, may, push, children, to, turn, to, inactive, lifestyles, fit, india, movement, may, not, reach, the, people, of, below, poverty, line, to, maintain, a, healthy, lifestyle, both, physical, activity, and, nutritious, food, are, necessary, but, in, india, still, many, people, are, malnourished, and, some, people, do, not, have, access, to, safe, drinking, water, so, without, solving, the, issue, of, poverty, and, lack, of, access, to, affordable, nutritious, food, a, section, of, people, in, india, will, not, be, able, to, take, advantage, of, this, movement, some, people, are, already, focusing, on, fitness, we, can, observe, this, with, the, increasing, number, of, fitness, startups, but, that, is, a, small, proportion, of, people, generally, many, people, want, to, maintain, an, active, lifestyle, but, all, they, need, is, some, encouragement, so, this, movement, constantly, reminds, people, to, focus, on, fitness, goals, just, like, swachh, bharat, reminds, us, of, the, importance, of, keeping, our, surroundings, clean, since, the, invention, of, machines, the, value, of, workers, is, decreasing, they, are, made, to, work, to, support, the, machines, as, a, result, work, revolves, around, machines, and, not, humans, workers, are, forced, to, work, continuously, along, with, the, machine, people, are, now, engaging, in, trolling, and, cyberbullying, hiding, behind, devices, is, giving, them, the, courage, to, harass, other, people, which, they, may, not, do, face, to, face, this, is, the, deterioration, of, moral, values, some, companies, are, building, strategies, to, use, their, apps, for, a, longer, time, to, keep, us, addicted, to, their, apps, and, devices, so, that, they, can, show, advertisements, to, us, and, also, they, can, use, our, data, to, manipulate, our, decisions, for, their, profits, these, strategies, are, turning, humans, into, just, targets, industrialization, increased, work, hours, workers, faced, inhuman, conditions, humans, can, not, work, and, focus, continuously, like, machines, fast, forward, to, today, we, have, technological, devices, to, check, how, many, hours, we, actually, work, some, companies, want, to, be, connected, 24, hours, a, day, through, emails, and, messages, this, makes, people, feel, less, human, our, decision, making, skills, are, also, getting, affected, as, we, are, now, asking, search, engines, to, know, what, is, best, we, are, depending, on, the, knowledge, base, of, the, internet, even, at, offices, to, finish, the, work, at, hand, this, affects, cognitive, skills, to, think, read, learn, remember, and, reason, which, is, an, essential, quality, of, humans, many, face, to, face, communications, are, also, replaced, with, virtual, interactions, many, people, are, now, living, in, virtual, homes, which, is, the, smartphone, as, the, need, for, talking, with, each, other, is, reducing, the, ability, to, communicate, with, each, other, which, is, a, basic, quality, of, living, beings, is, declining, we, are, increasingly, depending, on, technological, devices, to, guide, us, for, example, we, keep, reminders, on, smartphones, and, google, the, questions, for, answers, we, are, outsourcing, the, activities, that, require, intelligence, to, technology, thinking, remembering, things, and, analyzing, are, essential, qualities, of, humans, too, much, dependence, on, technology, is, making, us, less, human, using, technology, people, are, maintaining, and, improving, relationships, with, their, friends, family, and, relatives, many, people, are, also, connecting, with, each, other, to, help, the, needy, and, inspire, each, other, so, now, we, have, better, tools, to, build, human, connections, technology, is, enabling, us, to, work, from, home, this, facility, is, helping, employers, to, be, more, understanding, towards, employees, many, companies, are, now, adding, elements, to, work, culture, with, the, help, of, technology, to, make, employees, feel, important, this, bill, gave, exclusive, powers, to, the, national, investigation, agency, nia, nia, can, take, any, person, into, their, custody, under, uapa, without, taking, prior, permission, from, the, state, government, this, is, against, the, federalism, which, is, guaranteed, by, the, constitution, of, india, labelling, organisations, as, terror, organisations, and, labelling, individuals, as, terrorists, are, quite, different, if, a, person, is, named, as, a, terrorist, he, she, will, face, social, exclusion, and, will, be, devoid, of, livelihood, opportunities, even, if, he, she, proved, otherwise, the, consequences, will, be, irreversible, for, example, in, 2016, alone, 67, of, the, cases, ended, in, acquittal, which, means, they, are, probably, innocent, if, someone, is, booked, under, uapa, the, burden, of, proving, their, innocence, is, on, them, this, new, amendment, is, enabling, the, government, to, seize, their, properties, then, how, will, they, pay, for, legal, expenses, to, prove, their, innocence, if, they, are, falsely, accused, this, will, provide, more, police, powers, to, the, central, government, the, provision, of, naming, individuals, as, terrorists, can, be, misused, for, example, recently, several, civil, activists, are, termed, as, urban, naxals, if, anyone, opposes, the, government, they, will, be, vulnerable, to, be, framed, as, terrorists, because, this, amendment, made, it, easier, to, label, anyone, as, a, terrorist, there, is, a, growing, threat, of, lone, wolf, terrorism, lone, wolf, terrorists, do, not, have, any, association, with, terrorist, organizations, but, they, commit, terror, attacks, alone, by, themselves, this, new, amendment, to, uapa, has, the, potential, to, curb, lone, wolf, terrorism, to, prevent, the, violation, of, human, rights, four, stage, scrutiny, is, added, designating, individuals, as, terrorists, is, not, started, by, india, the, us, european, union, and, china, also, have, this, provision, till, now, only, organizations, were, designated, as, terrorist, organizations, but, not, individuals, the, loophole, in, this, is, the, individuals, of, the, banned, organizations, are, forming, new, organizations, and, carrying, out, terror, activities, this, amendment, bill, for, the, unlawful, activities, prevention, act, allows, the, government, to, designate, individuals, as, terrorists, thereby, terror, attacks, can, be, prevented, there, is, a, need, to, act, tough, on, terrorism, amid, growing, threats, from, terrorists, so, strengthening, uapa, is, necessary, at, present, india, does, not, have, a, well, developed, infrastructure, to, ensure, the, security, of, data, on, the, other, hand, developed, countries, already, have, an, efficient, infrastructure, so, rushing, toward, data, localization, may, not, be, a, wise, step, because, without, efficient, infrastructure, the, data, is, prone, to, cyber, attacks, and, the, risk, is, severe, here, because, it, is, financial, data, but, as, the, laws, are, made, it, is, a, big, challenge, to, develop, efficient, infrastructure, at, a, faster, pace, storing, data, in, india, means, higher, operational, costs, for, payment, system, operators, because, in, other, countries, they, have, cheaper, alternatives, and, also, for, cross, border, transactions, they, have, to, store, the, data, in, two, places, which, increases, costs, there, is, a, probability, that, these, extra, costs, may, pass, on, to, the, consumers, data, localization, laws, result, in, the, setting, up, of, multiple, data, centers, locally, this, will, create, many, jobs, and, will, help, the, country, ’s, economy, immensely, it, will, also, drive, innovation, in, the, field, resulting, in, low, cost, solutions, while, investigating, crimes, there, will, be, a, need, to, access, the, payment, data, if, the, data, is, stored, abroad, it, is, very, difficult, to, take, permission, from, that, country, for, access, to, the, data, this, causes, delays, in, solving, crimes, if, the, data, is, stored, here, within, our, country, this, problem, will, be, avoided, india, is, a, big, consumer, market, for, many, foreign, companies, so, india, and, other, developing, countries, are, realizing, the, economic, value, of, the, data, and, the, importance, of, data, localization, with, data, localization, domestic, companies, and, the, country, ’s, economy, will, be, benefited, and, we, can, also, ensure, the, security, of, the, data, data, is, considered, a, new, form, of, wealth, generally, companies, use, data, to, understand, the, requirements, of, consumers, and, also, to, influence, their, behavior, new, products, can, be, developed, by, analyzing, the, data, to, meet, the, needs, of, consumers, so, the, data, has, an, economic, value, in, general, developed, countries, are, utilizing, this, opportunity, with, their, well, developed, infrastructure, we, are, in, a, globalized, world, at, present, the, world, is, running, on, the, free, flow, of, people, goods, services, and, data, data, localization, laws, seem, to, be, a, part, of, protectionist, policies, which, is, a, threat, to, the, free, flow, of, data, the, us, is, against, data, localization, laws, recently, at, the, g20, summit, donald, trump, the, president, of, the, us, spoke, against, data, localization, its, stance, is, natural, because, it, increases, the, operational, costs, of, us, companies, india, us, bilateral, relations, are, important, for, both, countries, because, we, are, intertwined, in, the, export, and, import, of, it, services, professionals, and, goods, etc, so, imposing, data, localization, laws, without, threatening, indo, us, relations, is, another, challenge, we, can, ensure, data, privacy, by, localizing, the, data, data, localization, may, result, in, government, surveillance, of, its, citizens, data, localization, is, important, for, data, sovereignty, which, means, the, data, of, the, citizens, should, be, owned, by, the, respective, governments, and, not, by, other, countries, the, law, is, very, clear, that, rti, is, not, just, concerned, with, government, bodies, alone, it, is, also, for, non, government, organisations, which, are, substantially, financed, and, controlled, by, the, government, there, are, numerous, subsidies, including, tax, exemptions, that, the, political, parties, enjoy, thereby, they, are, substantially, financed, by, the, government, political, parties, are, independent, bodies, they, need, not, be, accountable, to, the, public, they, were, not, established, by, the, constitution, or, an, act, of, parliament, the, rti, act, states, that, wherever, there, is, public, interest, those, organizations, need, to, be, transparent, and, come, under, the, ambit, of, the, law, there, are, numbers, of, private, organizations, today, whether, partially, funded, or, fully, schools, hospitals, etc, that, are, under, the, rti, act, and, not, just, government, organizations, there, are, adequate, provisions, in, the, income, tax, law, and, with, the, election, commission, so, that, people, can, have, whatever, information, they, want, the, rti, act, has, provisions, under, section, 8, which, mention, the, concept, of, competitive, interest, certain, exemptions, are, provided, in, cases, where, it, can, be, proved, that, divulging, information, can, hurt, the, competitive, advantage, of, the, party, this, is, not, just, a, problem, with, political, parties, but, a, lot, of, government, and, private, bodies, too, political, funding, is, believed, to, be, the, fountainhead, of, corruption, the, citizens, have, the, right, to, know, where, the, political, parties, are, raising, these, funds, from, how, they, spend, these, funds, and, the, basis, of, their, decisions, crony, capitalism, will, be, hugely, curbed, if, political, parties, are, brought, under, rti, act, under, the, it, act, political, parties, do, not, need, to, disclose, donations, that, they, get, below, inr, 20,000, an, informal, study, done, in, 2010, on, 6, key, political, parties, shows, that, they, raised, rs, 700, crore, 95, of, the, amount, was, raised, by, amounts, below, rs, 20,000, there, is, a, high, possibility, that, the, political, parties, use, this, loophole, to, their, advantage, political, parties, declare, certain, promises, in, their, manifestos, after, getting, elected, the, citizens, have, a, right, to, know, why, the, promises, made, by, the, political, parties, were, not, fulfilled, political, parties, are, central, to, the, functioning, of, democracy, political, parties, go, on, to, form, the, government, the, government, policies, are, then, governed, by, the, party, ’s, ideology, thereby, it, becomes, essential, for, political, parties, to, come, under, the, ambit, of, rti, if, political, parties, come, under, the, rti, it, will, affect, their, smooth, internal, functioning, rivals, may, use, rti, to, malign, each, other, also, since, the, political, parties, are, not, connected, to, the, public, directly, an, rti, would, be, invalid, indians, as, a, whole, consider, educational, institutions, as, job, machines, we, expect, to, enter, unemployed, and, come, out, with, employment, we, do, n’t, realize, that, we, will, have, to, upgrade, our, skills, to, become, worthy, of, employment, this, is, the, reason, that, more, than, 80, of, engineers, are, unemployable, and, the, figures, are, even, worse, for, the, non, engineers,   , though, we, have, been, establishing, national, level, institutes, for, the, past, 40, years, we, have, n’t, been, investing, to, maintain, their, standards, funds, are, needed, for, quality, education, even, the, top, indian, institutes, lack, proper, infrastructure, labs, resources, etc, and, even, whatever, is, available, is, just, for, the, sake, of, passing, the, students, in, the, examination, and, sitting, idle, the, rest, of, the, time, today, no, problem, has, a, single, solution, and, no, new, technology, is, related, to, a, single, discipline, we, need, multiple, inputs, from, multiple, disciplines, and, our, institutes, have, failed, in, doing, so, indian, students, perform, brilliantly, when, they, go, to, different, countries, in, the, field, of, research, it, means, that, we, do, n’t, lack, talent, we, lack, infrastructure, and, a, healthy, environment, for, our, sharp, minds, we, have, n’t, been, paying, our, teachers, on, the, scale, of, what, their, counterparts, earn, in, other, countries, as, a, result, people, are, reluctant, to, the, idea, of, teaching, as, a, career, we, have, also, failed, to, lure, successful, foreign, faculties, to, our, institutes, achieving, excellence, in, anything, takes, time, through, graduation, students, gain, so, much, knowledge, in, the, relevant, field, so, it, ’s, easier, for, employers, to, train, these, students, for, the, industrial, requirements, any, skill, can, be, learned, and, mastered, even, if, we, do, not, have, a, degree, in, that, and, programming, is, no, exception, even, if, someone, has, a, degree, in, it, they, have, to, learn, so, many, things, to, get, into, the, it, job, because, there, is, a, gap, between, the, industrial, standards, and, the, skills, that, are, taught, in, engineering, colleges, moreover, as, technology, is, constantly, evolving, even, if, someone, has, prepared, themselves, for, the, industrial, standards, in, their, graduation, they, have, to, learn, new, technologies, continuously, to, stay, relevant, in, the, job, market, so, as, the, learning, curve, will, be, there, even, for, it, students, students, from, non, it, backgrounds, can, also, learn, these, things, and, can, get, into, it, jobs, the, number, of, it, jobs, is, increasing, at, a, rapid, rate, due, to, the, tech, revolution, so, there, will, be, more, jobs, in, the, it, field, and, if, the, recruiters, are, very, strict, about, the, degree, they, may, miss, a, large, pool, of, talent, who, are, of, a, non, it, background,  , now, we, have, so, many, online, course, platforms, through, which, we, can, learn, almost, any, skill, from, experts, we, can, also, get, certificates, if, we, pass, the, tests, so, as, tim, cook, said, a, 4, year,   , degree, seems, old, and, traditional,  , in, many, of, india, ’s, engineering, colleges, we, can, easily, pass, the, subjects, even, if, do, not, have, much, knowledge, in, those, subjects, that, is, the, reason, many, companies, are, not, able, to, find, suitable, talent, even, if, there, are, so, many, eligible, graduates, so, the, willingness, to, become, an, expert, in, the, field, is, more, important, than, a, degree,  , if, a, student, from, non, it, background, chose, to, start, a, career, in, the, it, field, the, efforts, they, put, into, graduation, will, go, in, vain, even, though, the, new, programming, languages, are, replacing, the, old, ones, the, basic, concepts, are, the, same, for, almost, all, the, programming, languages, so, the, one, who, has, a, degree, in, coding, will, have, an, advantage, over, the, student, from, a, non, it, background, people, switch, careers, even, after, working, in, one, field, for, several, years,   , because, our, interests, do, change,   , so, when, someone, can, do, this, while, having, so, many, personal, responsibilities, it, is, much, easier, for,   , youngsters,   , to, learn, a, new, skill,  , variable, pay, definitely, increases, the, productivity, of, employees, high, performing, individuals, feel, well, compensated, and, rewarded, for, their, efforts, while, the, under, performing, ones, also, feel, motivated, to, improve, in, variable, pay, schemes, the, employees, feel, content, and, motivated, with, their, work, they, feel, that, they, are, an, active, part, of, the, organization, the, organization, recognizes, them, as, a, part, of, its, growth, and, values, their, efforts, variable, pay, helps, in, retaining, valuable, employees, this, helps, in, retaining, good, talent, for, long, periods, of, time, and, thereby, less, spending, on, hiring, new, talents, this, provides, stability, to, the, organization,   , it, has, been, seen, that, it, is, difficult, to, retain, employees, in, lean, times, when, they, are, on, variable, pay, schemes, workers, who, receive, commissions, do, well, when, business, is, good, but, they, do, poorly, when, business, is, bad, in, times, of, slow, business, even, top, salespeople, might, have, difficulty, making, enough, sales, to, earn, a, decent, living, if, the, market, is, slow, and, commissioned, workers, ca, n’t, earn, enough, they, may, look, for, other, employment, opportunities, in, lean, times, fixed, wages, can, be, more, effective, at, keeping, employees, from, leaving, for, other, opportunities, variable, pay, can, lead, to, unhealthy, competition, between, employees, they, become, less, willing, to, help, each, other, team, co, operation, may, get, affected, negatively, in, the, long, run, relations, among, colleagues, may, turn, bitter, whereas, in, fixed, pay, schemes, the, employees, are, able, to, maintain, cordial, relationships, in, the, office, mostly, sales, jobs, have, a, variable, component, this, might, negatively, impact, the, employee, ’s, attitude, towards, customers, they, may, force, the, customers, irrationally, just, to, make, profits, for, themselves, they, might, overstate, the, price, to, the, customers, just, to, make, more, profit, whereas, an, employee, with, a, fixed, salary, would, maintain, healthy, and, positive, relations, with, the, customers, striking, the, right, balance, in, their, approach, the, huge, data, we, produce, every, day, is, analyzed, and, fed, into, our, devices, through, algorithms, that, we, end, up, giving, more, and, more, control, of, our, lives, to, the, gadgets, we, may, feel, that, we, receive, all, these, services, for, free, but, they, come, at, the, cost, of, our, precious, time, and, attention, with, all, the, data, and, algorithms, our, apps, and, gadgets, without, our, conscious, knowledge, are, making, decisions, for, us, decision, making, is, was, one, of, the, qualities, that, made, humans, different, from, others, after, a, daily, 10, hour, shift, from, monday, to, friday, most, of, us, prefer, to, stay, at, home, on, the, holidays, we, surround, ourselves, with, laptops, tv, and, mobile, and, use, them, in, cycles, for, netflix, sports, social, media, etc, thinking, that, we, are, relaxing, rather, than, going, out, we, prefer, and, are, more, comfortable, with, online, chatting, instead, of, talking, to, people, for, real, there, are, fewer, meaningful, relationships, nowadays, because, of, all, the, above, factors, we, have, started, preferring, isolation, nuclear, technology, is, a, very, efficient, alternative, to, non, renewable, energy, resources, but, still, we, chose, to, move, ahead, with, more, and, more, types, of, nuclear, warheads, the, same, is, the, case, with, almost, every, other, invention, similarly, though, initially, ai, promised, better, lives, for, us, because, of, ai, we, have, started, losing, our, basic, human, qualities, we, have, started, losing, our, basic, human, habits, and, instincts, and, are, actually, governed, by, devices, and, apps, as, yuval, noah, harari, says, what, we, need, now, are, morality, and, spirituality, morality, is, about, reducing, suffering, in, the, world, and, spirituality, is, about, questioning, and, looking, for, answers, religions, provide, us, just, with, answers, and, no, scope, of, questions, religion, has, served, its, purpose, of, uniting, people, setting, up, structures, in, society, and, developing, trust, and, cooperation, but, in, the, 21st, century, we, are, thriving, towards, objective, realities, and, religion, is, an, inter, subjective, reality, and, now, the, only, thing, it, does, is, create, differences, in, the, world, brainwash, people, develop, animosity, for, other, beliefs, and, provide, rituals, that, are, just, shortcuts, to, becoming, a, good, person, a, muslim, may, pray, 5, times, a, day, a, hindu, may, pray, daily, for, hours, in, temples, a, christian, may, go, to, church, every, day, but, still, be, involved, in, immoral, activities, in, the, past, every, unknown, thing, dealt, with, religious, beliefs, but, now, science, technology, has, taken, over, everything, we, know, the, reasons, for, drought, earthquakes, windstorms, etc, they, are, scientific, phenomena, and, not, the, wrath, of, gods, anymore, due, to, their, technological, nature, neo, banks, do, not, need, any, physical, bank, branches, which, helps, them, save, on, overhead, costs, the, cost, of, running, the, business, thus, neo, banks, are, able, to, offer, lower, fees, and, higher, interest, rates, on, checking, and, savings, accounts, to, customers, people, do, n’t, trust, neo, banks, as, much, because, they, do, n’t, have, a, physical, presence, which, makes, them, a, risk, for, customers, in, case, of, any, issues, or, challenges, in, person, customer, service, may, appear, more, trustworthy, to, customers, tech, literacy, is, still, very, low, in, india, traditional, banks, can, meet, the, banking, requirements, of, less, tech, savvy, customers, or, people, in, rural, areas, of, the, country, who, prefer, face, to, face, interaction, with, the, manager, commercial, banks, help, to, create, credit, which, leads, to, increased, production, employment, and, consumer, spending, all, of, which, help, to, grow, the, economy, since, neo, banks, are, completely, digital, they, operate, 24, hours, a, day, and, their, services, can, be, accessed, at, any, time, they, are, easy, to, access, from, anywhere, through, a, smartphone, fintech, companies, can, open, specialized, neo, banks, that, target, a, specific, type, of, customer, ’s, needs, for, example, lxme, aims, to, become, india, ’s, first, neo, bank, for, women, which, will, offer, product, solutions, that, address, women, specific, financial, needs, and, emotional, preferences, 5, g, in, banking, will, bring, much, needed, financial, inclusion, to, india, ’s, rural, and, remote, populations, for, whom, access, to, a, physical, bank, is, not, possible, the, low, latency, of, 5, g, will, enable, the, inclusion, of, education, in, remote, areas, of, india, where, children, will, be, able, to, access, good, quality, education, at, home, without, any, network, lag, between, them, and, their, favorite, tutor, also, 5, g, will, make, it, possible, to, use, new, age, technologies, like, ar, and, vr, for, more, immersive, learning, in, schools, and, colleges, 5, g, will, vastly, increase, the, number, of, networks, that, can, be, connected, handling, up, to, a, trillion, internet, of, things, terminals, which, will, enable, machines, and, humans, in, a, factory, to, communicate, with, each, other, seamlessly, making, the, business, more, efficient, and, reducing, the, possibility, of, error, the, government, will, be, able, to, improve, its, governance, and, give, a, boost, to, its, digital, india, initiative, which, aims, to, ensure, the, government, ’s, services, are, made, available, to, citizens, electronically, making, the, country, digitally, empowered, in, the, field, of, technology, hydrogen, is, flammable, and, can, cause, fires, or, explosions, so, it, is, not, completely, safe, yet, if, the, production, of, hydrogen, fuel, uses, fossil, fuels, that, can, be, counterproductive, so, using, renewable, energy, to, produce, hydrogen, fuel, is, important, hydrogen, fuel, cell, vehicles, do, not, emit, greenhouse, gases, this, helps, to, fight, climate, change, as, many, countries, are, opting, for, energy, transition, clean, hydrogen, fuel, vehicles, along, with, other, alternative, fuel, vehicles, can, pave, the, way, to, sustainable, transportation, also, as, these, vehicles, do, not, emit, greenhouse, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, they, can, cut, air, pollution, to, a, great, extent, the, prices, of, fossil, fuels, are, increasing, continuously, so, if, more, hydrogen, vehicles, come, into, the, market, the, price, of, fossil, fuels, may, reduce, hydrogen, vehicles, are, much, quieter, than, fossil, fuel, based, vehicles, so, they, can, reduce, noise, pollution, too, if, the, hydrogen, fuel, escapes, into, the, air, it, can, increase, global, warming, during, the, covid, pandemic, time, social, media, helped, people, in, maintaining, their, social, life, social, media, made, it, possible, to, stay, connected, with, friends, and, loved, ones, all, the, time, we, can, easily, know, what, is, happening, in, their, lives, it, allowed, us, to, communicate, with, multiple, people, at, the, same, time, by, sharing, posts, due, to, social, media, now, we, have, the, opportunity, to, connect, with, many, people, even, if, they, do, not, live, in, our, area, before, social, media, we, could, interact, with, people, from, either, our, locality, or, the, places, we, go, by, following, friends, on, social, media, and, not, communicating, with, them, privately, we, can, only, know, the, things, they, post, on, their, accounts, we, may, not, know, much, about, what, is, really, happening, in, their, lives, that, means, we, will, have, no, meaningful, connections, with, friends, the, convenience, of, contacting, people, online, made, us, prefer, it, over, meeting, them, outside, a, few, people, now, have, social, anxiety, due, to, not, having, enough, face, to, face, interactions, when, we, avoid, talking, to, people, for, a, long, time, automatically, we, develop, a, fear, to, involve, in, small, talk, trolling, on, social, media, is, a, big, menace, it, is, affecting, the, self, esteem, of, many, people, and, is, also, making, them, avoid, forming, social, connections, in, the, book, igen, it, was, mentioned, that, in, the, next, decade, we, may, see, more, young, people, who, know, just, the, right, emoji, for, a, situation, but, not, the, right, facial, expression, this, can, become, true, if, we, prefer, virtual, life, over, real, life, through, close, knit, communities, or, micro, communities, based, on, shared, interests, on, social, media, along, with, private, messaging, social, media, gave, us, an, opportunity, to, build, real, connections, with, people, we, can, really, relate, to, neet, exam, standardizes, the, entrance, criterion, for, medical, education, across, the, country, as, a, high, score, is, required, to, get, into, government, medical, colleges, the, exam, ensures, meritocracy, but, every, year, less, than, 20, of, the, students, are, passing, the, exam, by, this, it, is, evident, that, the, quality, of, medical, education, in, other, countries, where, indian, students, are, studying, is, not, at, par, with, the, medical, education, in, india, so, it, is, very, important, to, take, steps, to, provide, affordable, and, high, quality, medical, education, in, india, as, the, exam, requires, additional, study, coaching, centers, are, taking, advantage, of, the, situation, and, are, charging, lakhs, of, rupees, for, the, coaching, for, the, neet, exam, so, due, to, this, students, who, can, not, afford, the, coaching, are, at, a, disadvantage, students, work, hard, to, score, well, in, class, 12, exams, but, all, that, hard, work, is, not, recognized, and, only, the, neet, score, is, considered, for, entry, into, medical, college, which, is, very, unfair, moreover, the, neet, exam, is, mainly, based, on, the, cbse, curriculum, so, state, board, students, have, to, study, additional, things, to, get, a, good, score, on, the, exam, a, high, score, in, the, neet, exam, is, required, to, get, admission, to, government, medical, colleges, in, india, it, costs, approximately, rs.1.25, crores, to, study, in, private, medical, colleges, in, india, so, many, students, are, forced, to, go, to, other, countries, such, as, china, ukraine, russia, the, philippines, etc, to, pursue, medical, education, in, those, countries, medical, education, costs, around, rs.35, lakhs, moreover, they, allow, students, with, low, neet, scores, but, above, cut, off, marks, some, people, moonlight, to, pursue, their, passion, when, the, earnings, from, their, passion, can, not, replace, the, salary, from, their, main, job, several, entrepreneurs, take, this, route, and, leave, their, jobs, once, they, earn, enough, from, their, new, ventures, as, per, a, study, published, by, the, academy, of, management, journal, in, 2021, moonlighting, can, provide, a, sense, of, control, and, motivation, which, can, improve, the, productivity, of, employees, the, sudden, layoffs, by, several, companies, especially, during, the, pandemic, caused, fear, in, many, employees, and, hence, several, people, took, up, side, gigs, or, a, second, job, as, a, safety, net, in, case, they, are, laid, off, moonlighting, can, help, in, upskilling, a, few, people, want, to, learn, new, skills, apart, from, what, they, are, working, on, in, their, primary, job, this, can, help, them, in, developing, expertise, in, their, field, some, might, get, bored, with, monotonous, jobs, and, hence, take, up, second, jobs, to, learn, new, skills, and, thereby, make, their, days, exciting, companies, fear, information, and, sensitive, data, theft, and, the, possibility, of, sharing, it, with, their, rival, companies, some, managers, are, worrying, that, the, employees, who, moonlight, may, not, be, productive, in, their, primary, job, due, to, fatigue, and, increased, stress, there, are, also, concerns, about, working, for, other, companies, during, the, office, hours, of, my, primary, job, in, general, companies, provide, several, benefits, to, employees, such, as, provident, fund, health, insurance, etc, so, they, feel, it, is, unfair, when, their, employees, focus, their, energy, and, time, on, a, second, job, which, does, n’t, provide, any, of, those, benefits, a, cashless, economy, saves, so, much, money, for, governments, because, printing, money, and, sending, the, money, to, banks, requires, money, and, human, resources, the, need, to, purchase, or, rent, land, for, atms, will, also, be, eliminated, international, payments, will, also, be, easier, because, there, is, no, need, to, exchange, currency, cashless, transactions, leave, digital, footprints, of, financial, transactions, they, can, be, used, to, trace, illegal, activities, covid, pandemic, increased, the, number, of, cashless, transactions, they, can, prevent, the, spread, of, contagious, diseases, cashless, transactions, are, recorded, by, banks, so, the, data, will, reveal, the, critical, data, of, people, regarding, where, they, spend, money, the, government, can, easily, access, the, data, of, anyone, it, may, result, in, mass, surveillance, programs, this, goes, against, the, right, to, privacy, cash, gives, us, anonymity, a, cashless, economy, will, increase, the, number, of, cybercrimes, technical, issues, in, banking, can, halt, access, to, our, money, this, can, interfere, with, our, daily, lives, refugees, are, forcibly, displaced, they, flee, their, country, for, several, reasons, such, as, violence, human, rights, violations, war, persecution, of, minorities, etc, often, they, face, threats, to, life, in, their, home, countries, they, leave, their, homes, and, everything, else, in, search, of, a, safer, place, to, live, at, present, many, countries, are, refusing, refugees, stating, that, they, pose, an, economic, or, security, threat, only, a, few, countries, including, lebanon, jordan, turkey, and, liberia, are, accepting, most, of, the, refugees, some, host, countries, are, forcibly, sending, refugees, back, to, their, home, countries, stating, that, such, as, the, situation, in, their, home, countries, is, safe, many, refugees, who, were, sent, like, this, went, through, brutal, violence, and, some, people, even, disappeared, all, countries, should, share, the, responsibility, for, refugees, resettlement, of, the, refugees, should, be, done, without, much, delay, they, should, be, provided, with, skill, development, courses, and, employment, opportunities, to, help, them, in, living, a, dignified, life, a, weak, global, response, is, worsening, the, situation, of, refugees, the, international, community, should, help, in, rebuilding, the, war, torn, countries, where, refugees, are, coming, from, so, that, safe, and, dignified, returns, are, possible, for, refugees, refugees, should, not, be, forcibly, sent, to, their, home, countries, many, developed, countries, are, spending, so, much, money, to, protect, their, borders, but, are, not, spending, any, money, for, protecting, the, lives, of, refugees, more, funding, is, required, to, protect, refugees, in, general, a, few, teachers, punish, students, who, are, not, scoring, well, in, exams, but, they, do, not, even, try, to, understand, whether, they, have, any, learning, disabilities, this, causes, self, esteem, issues, in, students, psychologists, can, detect, these, learning, disabilities, and, can, detect, these, issues, and, can, collaborate, with, teachers, to, draft, teaching, strategies, that, are, suitable, for, students, with, learning, disabilities, many, students, struggle, with, several, issues, such, as, anxiety, self, esteem, issues, trouble, forming, friendships, etc, guidance, and, support, are, very, important, to, help, them, overcome, these, problems, so, educational, institutions, should, have, mental, health, professionals, to, help, students, in, 2020, on, average, 34, students, committed, suicide, every, day, due, to, several, reasons, such, as, exam, pressure, and, relationship, issues, so, it, is, very, important, to, provide, support, for, them, in, educational, institutions, counselors, can, help, them, to, cope, with, the, pressures, and, can, help, in, improving, their, mental, health, if, the, student, suffers, from, mental, health, issues, such, as, severe, depression, counselors, will, take, steps, to, get, them, treated, by, psychiatrists, the, covid, pandemic, affected, the, mental, health, of, many, people, as, schools, and, colleges, were, shut, down, for, a, long, time, many, students, felt, isolated, and, that, caused, an, even, more, negative, impact, on, mental, health, as, schools, and, colleges, have, reopened, students, need, help, to, adapt, to, the, new, normal, some, students, do, not, even, understand, what, they, are, going, through, they, may, not, even, know, how, to, ask, for, help, having, a, counselor, at, their, educational, institution, will, help, them, a, lot, in, understanding, their, issues, moreover, they, will, learn, how, to, ask, for, advice, and, help, when, college, education, is, free, the, number, of, graduates, will, drastically, increase, at, present, many, people, do, not, have, access, to, higher, education, so, many, students, are, not, joining, colleges, due, to, the, financial, status, of, their, parents, free, education, will, be, very, helpful, for, them, at, present, the, rich, are, getting, richer, and, poor, people, are, getting, poorer, a, free, college, education, will, reduce, social, inequality, too, because, as, everyone, can, study, and, learn, the, skills, in, college, everyone, will, have, an, equal, opportunity, to, settle, in, the, career, of, their, choice, some, students, are, taking, education, loans, to, study, and, then, they, have, to, work, hard, to, repay, their, loans, many, people, are, forced, to, take, up, jobs, immediately, after, college, to, repay, loans, but, with, free, education, they, will, have, the, liberty, in, career, choices, like, choosing, a, job, or, becoming, entrepreneurs, or, experimenting, with, gigs, etc, there, is, a, shortage, of, skilled, workers, in, many, countries, when, college, education, is, free, this, problem, will, be, solved, at, present, private, investments, in, education, led, to, improvement, in, the, quality, of, education, without, the, commercialization, of, education, the, quality, of, education, may, not, improve, much, less, disruption, to, public, life, less, road, traffic, and, less, loss, to, our, economy, as, all, the, government, staff, can, be, used, at, a, single, time, we, can, also, increase, vigilance, and, factors, like, black, money, booth, capturing, etc, can, be, reduced, holding, both, elections, together, will, also, mean, mixing, up, the, national, issues, with, those, of, the, state, the, national, issues, would, overpower, the, state, which, in, turn, would, get, less, priority, from, the, politicians, when, state, elections, are, conducted, along, with, the, center, the, regional, parties, may, get, marginalized, because, the, same, party, getting, majority, in, the, center, may, get, votes, in, the, state, as, well, frequent, elections, in, the, country, will, bring, politicians, back, to, the, public, frequently, whereas, cutting, down, on, elections, would, mean, making, them, lazy, for, the, rest, of, the, term, and, suddenly, becoming, overactive, during, the, election, year, almost, 3, lakh, people, were, employed, in, the, firecracker, industry, in, these, places, and, 5, lakh, people, in, packaging, transporting, distributing, and, selling, these,

firecrackers, will, definitely, be, a, cut, down, in, entertainment, and, recreation, for, the, kids, as, well, as, the, elders, banning, firecrackers, in, some, places, currently, having, pollution, at, its, peak, like, delhi, ncr, will, obviously, bring, down, the, poisonous, emission, of, gases, which, has, deadly, effects, on, the, entire, balanced, ecosystem, the, highest, level, of, particulate, matter, recorded, in, delhi, was, 2.5, in, the, year, 2016, which, indeed, made, delhi, the, most, polluted, city, in, the, world, in, terms, of, air, pollution, the, central, pollution, control, board, also, stated, that, the, level, of, sulfur, dioxide, in, the, air, gets, tremendously, high, between, 9, p.m., till, midnight, during, deepavali, the, crackers, regulated, in, the, market, comprise, chemical, components, like, saltpeter, carbon, and, sulfur, when, these, are, ignited, altogether, hazardous, oxides, of, gases, are, emitted, which, cause, suffocation, reduce, visibility, and, other, health, hazards, medical, experts, state, that, the, air, gets, contaminated, with, toxic, gases, and, remains, for, days, after, diwali, the, toxic, elements, that, reach, the, lungs, can, not, be, removed, thereafter, and, can, cause, grave, health, issues, this, will, cause, long, term, effects, on, children, with, the, ban, religious, sentiments, get, triggered, too, in, 2017, the, hindu, community, raised, questions, about, the, ban, on, christmas, trees, on, christmas, or, slaughter, of, lamb, on, eid, or, colors, on, holi, etc, thinking, it, to, be, against, their, communal, practices, india, is, the, second, most, populous, country, in, the, world, it, is, already, difficult, for, the, indian, government, to, provide, food, security, and, basic, necessities, to, all, the, people, of, india, adding, more, burden, to, this, will, worsen, the, situation, accommodating, refugees, will, cause, resettling, of, some, indians, the, indian, government, tried, to, give, shelter, to, rohingyas, by, resettling, some, in, the, jammu, region, this, may, not, be, the, right, step, and, will, cause, distress, to, the, resettled, indians, rohingyas, have, their, own, set, of, ethnicity, and, culture, by, accepting, them, we, will, just, be, adding, more, culture, to, the, already, vast, culture, of, india, letting, the, rohingya, go, back, to, the, place, where, they, do, not, get, recognition, means, more, loss, of, human, lives, and, to, a, greater, extent, the, population, of, the, rohingya, is, 1.1, million, and, if, the, violence, and, torture, continues, on, them, then, there, will, be, no, person, left, in, the, community, acceptance, of, the, rohingyas, will, definitely, throw, a, good, impression, of, the, hospitality, of, our, country, to, the, foreign, land, this, will, improve, india, ’s, chances, to, secure, permanent, membership, in, united, nations, security, council, unsc, accepting, refugees, escaping, from, death, situations, is, surely, an, act, of, humanity, rohingya, people, have, been, treated, brutally, by, the, burmese, government, due, to, racism, being, a, neighboring, country, we, should, be, accepting, those, people, who, are, in, deep, distress, allowing, refugees, is, a, potential, security, threat, to, any, country, refugees, can, be, an, easy, prey, to, terrorists, they, may, take, advantage, of, the, situation, and, may, carry, out, illegal, activities, using, refugees, consensual, sex, can, also, be, termed, as, rape, if, the, wife, is, willing, to, file, a, false, case, there, will, be, no, proof, to, prove, whether, it, is, consensual, or, not, punishing, men, based, on, the, mere, words, of, wives, is, completely, wrong, because, of, the, presumption, that, women, do, not, lie, good, and, bad, are, not, related, to, gender, there, are, women, criminals, too, the, most, misused, law, in, the, indian, judicial, system, is, section, 498a, which, allows, women, to, file, a, case, on, a, husband, and, his, family, in, case, of, dowry, harassment, many, women, are, using, this, law, to, extort, money, and, property, from, their, in, laws, if, the, law, on, marital, rape, comes, into, effect, many, innocent, men, will, be, at, threat, sexual, violence, violates, human, rights, irrespective, of, the, relationship, between, the, criminal, and, the, victim, ipc, 375, which, criminalizes, rape, discriminates, against, married, women, for, using, the, section, on, their, husbands, though, one, can, file, a, case, under, the, domestic, violence, act, for, marital, rape, not, terming, marital, rape, as, a, crime, will, deter, the, victims, from, filing, cases, every, law, on, the, planet, is, prone, to, be, misused, that, does, n’t, mean, that, we, should, not, have, laws, in, order, to, avoid, false, cases, there, will, be, no, sense, of, security, we, can, not, sleep, peacefully, because, the, cryptocurrency, ’s, value, keeps, on, fluctuating, standard, currencies, fluctuate, too, but, not, as, high, as, cryptocurrencies, if, the, value, of, standard, currency, falls, we, can, still, afford, to, live, in, our, country, because, the, fall, of, currency, value, impacts, all, fields, for, example, if, the, prices, of, groceries, rise, so, do, our, salaries, but, if, the, value, of, cryptocurrencies, like, bitcoin, falls, we, will, lose, our, hard, earned, money, the, future, belongs, to, technology, cryptocurrencies, make, peer, to, peer, financial, transactions, a, lot, easier, this, currency, can, be, sent, from, any, part, of, the, world, to, any, part, of, the, world, hence, there, will, be, no, struggle, of, exchanging, currencies, like, dollars, for, the, rupee, etc, while, traveling, the, world, there, will, no, hurdle, of, exchanging, our, currencies, with, local, currencies, reality, shows, give, opportunity, for, children, to, bring, out, their, hidden, talents, and, to, train, their,

sad, thing, is, that, culprits, are, left, unpunished, why, everything, is, seen, in, a, sexual, nature, brahmacharya, does, n't, mean, women, can, not, worship, god, brahmacharya, means, observing, celibacy, it, does, n't, mean, that, there, should, n't, be, female, devotees, of, reproductive, age, narrow, minded, people, do, not, understand, the, difference, between, devotion, and, sexual, attraction, some, other, temples, also, ban, women, and, some, temples, ban, men, if, it, is, the, same, situation, with, sabarimala, people, would, n't, have, bothered, about, it, but, treating, menstruation, as, impure, and, banning, women, of, reproductive, age, is, regressive, and, need, to, address, menstruation, is, just, a, biological, process, not, allowing, menstruating, women, in, temples, sends, a, wrong, message, to, people, and, future, generations, sabarimala, temple, is, taking, funds, from, government, and, hence, state, government, has, the, right, to, make, changes, in,

the, incident, and, ask, questions, the, victim, 's, family, when, they, really, need, some, space, and, time, to, grieve, they, are, good, time, managers, as, most, of, the, women, today, manage,

better, managers, than, men, such, competitions, and, beauty, pageant, have, a, very, wrong, influence, on, society, as, we, all, quickly, follow, the, media, trends, all, this, is, basically, sending, the, wrong, message, to, our, younger, generation, girls, where, they, are, made, to, understand, that, being, perfect, and, pretty, is, extremely, necessary, this, affects, their, self, esteem, and, may, even, cause, depression, they, promote, cosmetic, surgeries, women, these, days, are, ready, to, spend, thousands, of, dollars, on, getting, hair, extensions, fake, teeth, botox,

large, amount, of, time, to, complete, and, if, in, the, next, presidential, elections, any, other, person, gets, elected, there, will, be, more, chances, of, him, her, stopping, the, construction, of, the, wall, according, to, the, reports, illegal, crossing, of, the, borders, has, actually, decreased, from, the, year, 2014, to, 2015, which, renders, no, use, in, building, the, wall, india, has, always, been, kind, to, refugees, hence, the, same, spirit, should, be, continued, in, the, case, of, rohingya, community, accepting, refugees, escaping, from, death, situations, is, surely, an,

female, victims, hence, it, is, discriminatory, to, male, victims, punishing, men, based, on, mere, words, of, wives, is, completely, wrong, because, of, the, presumption, that, women, do, not, lie, good, and, bad, are, not, related, to, gender, there, are, women, criminals, too, ipc, 375, which, criminalizes, rape, discriminates, married, women, from, using, the, section, on, their, husbands, these, days, every, man, is, considered, as, a, potential, rapist, if, a, woman, makes, a, false, molestation, complaint, against, a, man, out, of, revenge, or, any, other, motive, society, is, more, likely, to, believe, the, woman, 's, words, society, and, media, exposes, the, accused, before, the, investigation, this, kind, of, attitude, of, society, helps, victims, in, genuine, cases, but, the, scope, of, false, cases, is, ignored, however, the, same, is, not, true, with, the, complaints, against, women, if, the, complaint, is, against, a, woman, people, doubt, about, the, genuinity, of, the, case, what, if, the, sexual, harassment, case, against, the, man, is, a, false, case, some, people, think, like, men, can, take, anything, false, molestation, cases, will, result, in, the,

are, pushing, star, kids, to, launch, in, their, movies, failing, to, judge, their, acting, skills, and, screen, presence, this, leads, to, flop, movies, and, a, loss, of, quality, and, standards, of, the, indian, cinemas, star, kids, also, have, an, upbringing, which, is, surrounded, by, the, bollywood, industry, this, gives, them, an, advantage, of, getting, adjusted, and, having, a, clearer,

especially, in, emerging, countries, that, will, be, responsible, for, most, of, the, greenhouse, gas, emissions, in, a, few, decades, otherwise, but, to, convince, them, to, grow, green, we, have, to, acknowledge, that, we, are, denying, them, the, way, to, build, their, economy, as, we, did, in, the, past, 200, years, so, we, must, support, emerging, countries, in, their, transition, to, a, green, economy, if, all, costs, including, co2, emissions, of, the, production, the, extraction, of, resources, and, its, consequences, for, the, region, environment, and, humans, ecosystem, damage, recycling, of, the, waste, and, so, on, and, so, forth, would, be, monetized, and, internalized, in, the, costs, of, the, products, many, of, our, problems, would, be, solved, it, would, simply, make, the, more, environmentally, friendly, products, cheaper, than, the, others, and, their, production, economically, smarter, in, a, capitalist, system, in, which, all, environmental, and, social, and, health, costs, of, everybody, affected, would, be, internalized, in, the, pricing, of, a, product, the, market, could, solve, most, problems, this, would, strengthen, the, carbon, sinks, across, europa, this, would, address, the, current, issues, on, habitats, and, species, loss, gas, power, plants, produce, co2, climate, damaging, methane, is, released, during, extraction, and, transport, nuclear, power, plants, produce, radioactive, waste, a, legacy, for, future, generations, not, to, mention, the, current, danger, of, release, e.g., through, attacks, geological, events, or, operational, accidents, due, to, human, or, technical, errors, if, we, continue, investing, in, climate, and, environmentally, damaging, regressive, and, immensely, expensive, nuclear, power, plants, or, technologies, is, a, mockery, of, the, world, and, a, waste, of, money, and, time, that, we, can, use, for, sustainable, investments, and, transformations, it, is, essential, that, environmental, concerns, and, sustainability, are, the, foundation, of, any, treaty, with, our, european, union, it, 's, by, no, means, irrelevant, what, kind, of, cars, people, use, 25, renewable, +, 25, nuclear, +, 50, combustible, is, better, than, 100, combustible, gasoline, non, gasoline, cars, improve, local, air, quality, on, city, streets, in, order, to, improve, the, protection, of, the, environment, the, use, of, fresh, pulp, should, no, longer, be, allowed, for, toilet, paper, being, against, solar, energy, in, my, opinion, is, simply, irrational,   , insects, also, die, by, windmills, sometimes, but, much, more, often, from, hunger, birds, or, herbicides, insecticides, etc, this, idea, is, what, we, have, been, doing, for, the, last, 30, years, it, did, not, produce, sufficient, results, to, justify, continuing, on, this, path, it, is, just, saying, that, problem, will, solve, itself, this, proposition, is, harmful, and, does, not, stand, on, any, data, that, could, justify, it,   , it, is, not, about, blaming, others, it, is, about, seeing, the, situation, as, it, is, recognizing, patterns, reasons, and, consequences, of, our, behavior, we, do, not, make, our, choices, in, a, vacuum, if, it, is, easier, and, cheaper, to, live, not, sustainably, people, will, do, it, even, if, they, are, conscious, of, the, consequences, we, should, arrange, our, cities, our, economy, and, politics, so, that, it, is, easy, for, people, to, behave, ecologically, responsibly, it, requires, a, lot, of, work, now, but, it, is, work, that, we, have, to, do, if, we, want, to, transition, to, something, more, sustainable, sustainable, and, animal, friendly, farms, grow, their, own, feed, and, create, an, ecological, cycle, the, current, subsidies, with, a, modular, system, of, incentives, should, be, replaced, as, that, empowers, farmers, to, choose, environmentally, socially, and, financially, responsible, and, sustainable, solutions, that, are, already, available, like, natural, sequence, farming, regenerative, agriculture, permaculture, etc, in, germany, 60, of, the, land, is, used, for, animal, feed, in, determining, how, much, subsidy, a, holding, receives, the, area, of, the, holding, is, decisive, in, other, words, a, lot, of, land, a, large, amount, of, subsidy, this, results, in, cheap, animal, feed, and, ultimately, intensive, livestock, farming, thus, if, the, state, subsidises, animal, feed, and, livestock, farming, on, the, basis, of, their, size, and, not, on, the, basis, of, sustainability, and, animal, welfare, the, concept, of, intensive, livestock, farming, will, be, supported, and, not, just, the, batteries, the, eu, should, have, an, overall, policy, with, a, clear, goal, to, restrict, and, reduce, planned, obsolescence, having, to, replace, an, entire, mobile, phone, or, tablet, camera, notebook, etc, because, a, battery, reached, the, end, of, its, useful, life, is, infuriating, it, is, not, just, a, strain, on, consumers, wallets, it, is, also, devastating, for, the, environment, as, the, energy, and, resources, going, into, manufacture, of, electronics, is, artificially, increased, through, the, short, lifespans, these, devices, have, cbam, is, a, central, element, towards, a, global, approach, to, reach, net, zero, emissions, by, 2050, and, to, mitigate, global, warming, if, we, want, stable, reliable, energy, grid, we, need, a, nuclear, energy, source, solar, energy, and, wind, are, not, reliable, need, a, lot, of, batteries, and, can, not, be, a, sole, solution, for, the, energy, grid, taxation, seems, to, be, the, only, real, way, to, incentivize, other, countries, less, worried, about, climate, change, to, work, on, it, we, should, restrict, delocalizing, factories, to, third, countries, where, environmental, legislation, is, softer, we, need, unique, legislation, to, avoid, this, as, the, sustainability, goals, of, the, un, contain, working, conditions, human, rights, environmental, climate, issues, together, with, questions, of, governance, they, are, ideal, to, incentivize, sustainability, in, all, sectors, and, fend, off, unsustainable, practices, and, competition, we, must, protect, our, planet, and, without, bees, wasps, or, other, arthropods, we, go, to, our, own, extinction, without, bees, which, are, dying, en, masse, europe, ’s, existence, is, impossible, the, problem, is, complex, and, it, is, about, the, influence, of, poisonous, pesticides, and, other, agricultural, and, industrial, chemicals, as, well, as, the, influence, of, gsm, technologies, which, lead, to, overheating, of, the, bee, ’s, body, which, falls, under, the, negative, impact, of, microwaves, therefore, europe, must, create, a, series, of, policies, to, help, bees, survive, in, the, name, of, the, surplus, of, european, nations, it, is, important, to, see, immigrants, as, people, who, have, a, culture, a, religious, perspective, and, a, very, different, but, respectable, idea, of, sociality, compared, to, the, european, one, that, 's, why, we, must, act, in, a, coordinated, and, careful, manner, between, institutions, and, organizations, such, a, hub, could, also, have, a, bridging, role, between, local, necessities, and, opportunities, at, the, eu, level, such, as, project, funding, the, hub, could, also, organize, events, to, spread, awareness, in, the, local, population, on, topics, related, to, migration, in, order, to, boost, social, inclusion, processes, and, fight, the, spreading, of, fake, news, and, ostracism, of, migrant, people, the, british, voted, to, leave, the, eu, therefore, all, british, have, the, same, obligations, as, immigrants, from, non, eu, countries, the, british, people, voted, for, brexit, so, now, naturally, they, have, to, live, with, their, choice,   , it, turns, out, you, ca, n't, actually, have, your, cake, and, eat, it, too, i, think, this, is, a, good, idea, but, unfortunately, it, 's, framed, as, a, british, brexit, issue, however, the, wider, concept, of, a, common, eu, visa, migration, system, is, a, compelling, one, harmonising, the, system, to, a, common, visa, regime, offers, many, advantages, british, people, are, not, better, than, anyone, else, and, do, not, deserve, special, treatment, from, the, eu, the, british, people, will, face, the, consequences, of, their, decision, to, leave, the, eu, and, it, is, not, the, eu, 's, responsibility, to, make, brexit, painless, the, benefits, of, membership, can, not, be, bestowed, upon, citizens, of, countries, outside, the, eu, eea, like, the, uk, it, is, truly, a, pity, that, many, people, lost, many, of, their, rights, overnight, one, year, ago, it, is, actually, a, pity, that, the, uk, even, made, such, a, decision, brexit, was, the, decision, of, generally, uninformed, or, misinformed, people, who, ca, n't, be, blamed, for, it, especially, the, ones, that, actually, voted, to, remain, or, the, ones, that, did, n't, get, to, vote, at, all, the, truth, is, that, the, uk, was, always, sort, of, the, black, sheep, in, the, eu, even, historically, the, uk, was, often, somewhat, detached, from, european, politics, and, issues, the, cohesion, funds, have, become, a, mechanism, for, local, oligarchs, and, political, elites, to, maintain, their, power, and, influence, within, national, contexts, thus, resulting, in, utilizing, eu, funds, for, their, own, personal, or, political, gains, and, withholding, the, benefits, from, the, people, in, cities, and, regions, an, increased, percentage, of, funds, dedicated, to, cities, and, regions, that, are, controlled, and, distributed, from, the, eu, institutions, directly, to, the, local, administrations, can, bypass, the, national, systems, which, enable, the, political, dependency, in, the, first, place, this, will, add, to, the, transparency, and, fair, competition,   , insincere, employers, should, n't, have, an, advantage, and, in, essence, it, would, be, beneficial, for, all, eu, members, not, just, the, workers, protection, of, the, rights, of, those, who, actually, produce, the, services, and, products, that, constitutes, the, european, market, is, nothing, but, self, evident, with, a, more, and, more, integrated, eu, ignoring, those, rights, will, create, fragmentation, and, conflicts, the, recent, crisis, on, the, polish, border, only, underlines, the, urgency, of, this, proposal, europe, can, no, longer, afford, to, neglect, to, defend, its, external, borders, and, promote, policies, that, favor, illegal, migration, and, fuel, human, trafficking, strong, and, effective, borders, are, the, pre, condition, to, any, aspect, of, a, common, migration, policy, this, should, help, to, tackle, the, causes, of, lack, of, prospects, and, absconding, from, these, countries, in, order, to, increase, the, willingness, of, young, people, to, stay, in, their, homes, frontex, interfering, with, the, national, border, guards, doing, their, sacred, duty, to, protect, the, border, and, then, sending, anonymous, reports, to, criticize, these, brave, men, and, women, is, quite, abhorrent, i, work, on, a, programme, in, ireland, to, help, migrants, refugees, and, asylum, seekers, get, employment, and, integrate,   , the, qualifications, skills, experience, and, resilience, they, bring, is, amazing, and, so, valuable, to, employers, and, the, country,   , there, is, far, too, much, focus, on, negative, aspects, of, migration, much, of, it, based, on, incorrect, stereotypes,   , migration, brings, lots, of, positives, to, countries, but, we, need, to, be, open, to, them, we, have, n't, got, enough, jobs, and, money, for, everyone, in, europe, stop, immigration, however, turkey, qatar, oman, egypt, u.a.e, ., and, saudi, arabia, have, it, these, countries, can, therefore, welcome, migrants, instead, of, funding, hundreds, of, mosques, in, europe, why, do, we, even, let, in, migrants, who, do, not, speak, the, language, of, the, country, where, they, wish, to, reside, migration, is, bad, for, the, nations, and, degrading, for, the, migrants, we, must, work, to, end, mass, migration, indigenous, europeans, have, no, obligation, to, take, in, any, more, migrants, and, neither, do, they, want, to, this, is, being, forced, on, us, it, 's, only, anecdotal, evidence, but, i, have, noticed, in, the, high, schools, in, my, area, that, the, children, from, migrants, are, more, able, to, participate, in, after, school, activities, when, their, language, is, developed, further, children, of, course, still, go, to, school, on, a, daily, basis, which, means, that, they, automatically, are, taking, part, in, language, lessons, however, seeing, the, positive, results, in, language, learning, in, these, children, i, can, imagine, that, their, parents, would, benefit, in, the, same, way, if, they, were, given, the, opportunity, to, follow, language, lessons, ideally, low, budget, free, each, migrant, in, the, european, union, must, be, given, the, possibility, to, integrate, even, if, the, refugee, status, is, not, clear, integration, programs, could, support, this, development, in, all, cases, no, europe, is, not, a, colony, immigration, has, been, devastating, public, eu, officials, who, support, immigration, should, be, named, and, the, european, people, must, be, given, a, democratic, opportunity, to, remove, them, from, positions, of, power, and, influence, we, have, millions, of, poor, true, europeans, that, we, can, help, why, help, migrant, who, have, nothing, in, common, with, us, most, of, the, time, migrants, have, trouble, fitting, into, society, because, of, the, language, barrier, and, hate, providing, them, with, language, lessons, could, reduce, the, tensions, around, migration, and, improve, the, migrants, integration, knowledge, of, the, host, country, 's, language, is, essential, for, integration, when, migrants, understand, the, local, language, studies, show, that, their, values, tend, towards, those, of, the, host, countries, over, time, it, is, essential, that, european, principles, and, values, are, taught, to, migrants, including, an, explanation, of, the, reasoning, behind, these, principles, and, values, it, would, be, best, that, this, is, provided, both, in, the, person, 's, mother, tongue, and, in, the, language, of, the, host, country, for, more, than, 50, years, immigration, has, been, going, on, uncontrolled, and, unchecked, no, changes, need, to, be, made, before, we, have, an, agreement, that, people, ignoring, our, immigration, laws, should, be, detained, in, repatriation, facilities, with, no, chance, of, re, entering, the, eu, once, we, agree, on, that, we, can, start, talking, about, funds, and, resources, for, those, who, do, deserve, help, working, in, sectors, in, ample, need, of, workers, such, as, the, agricultural, fields, will, help, to, integrate, immigrants, once, their, situation, has, been, legalized, and, above, all, education, is, needed, an, intensive, integration, education, both, in, the, language, of, course, and, also, culture, history, philosophy, literature, etc, europe, needs, more, women, to, have, children, and, raise, them, in, a, good, manner, which, helps, transmit, our, culture, our, culture, is, a, praise, to, the, world, and, must, be, saved, from, globalization, invasion, and, destruction, mass, migration, is, an, evil, that, hurts, the, nations, as, well, as, the, migrants, themselves, who, suffer, indignities, and, risk, their, lives, we, must, end, mass, migration, this, requires, that, migrants, be, helped, as, close, to, the, origin, of, migration, as, possible, eu, bureaucrats, who, have, enabled, immigration, must, be, named, and, a, democratic, process, for, removing, them, from, power, must, be, put, into, place,   , democracy, must, prevail, over, this, multicultural, fascism, i, think, eu, bureaucrats, and, politicians, should, set, an, example, for, the, rest, of, merkle, in, particular, they, should, also, donate, 30, of, their, wages, to, them, ngo, boats, should, be, forbidden, only, frontex, should, intervene, to, bring, them, home, an, outright, ban, on, muslim, countries, is, ridiculous, the, leadership, of, these, countries, and, the, media, depictions, of, the, people, of, these, countries, do, not, reflect, the, actual, people, who, live, there, they, are, no, threat, to, us, gender, is, a, far, left, concept, that, has, nothing, to, do, with, biology, the, physical, universe, and, reality, if, we, want, to, uphold, to, our, standards, and, what, the, eu, represents, we, shall, help, those, immigrants, and, give, them, the, tools, to, help, us, make, our, homes, better, and, multicultural, so, when, the, chance, is, presented, they, can, then, have, a, way, to, help, their, countries, simply, blocking, them, out, of, our, region, and, neglecting, them, wo, n't, solve, anything, we, will, only, make, unnecessary, enemies, the, world, in, particular, africa, and, the, middle, east, is, experiencing, a, huge, population, explosion, they, seem, not, to, be, able, to, cope, with, it, as, china, did,   , who, is, going, to, take, all, these, millions, of, refugees, which, result, from, it,   , also, consider, that, the, integration, of, one, non, western, immigrant, costs, 167.000, euros,   , if, the, eu, intends, to, survive, it, has, to, stop, more, or, less, all, migration, we, need, to, ensure, fair, redistribution, of, refugees, across, europe, and, ensure, better, integration, of, refugees, and, applicants, for, international, protection, into, the, workplace, more, concrete, and, fairer, european, policy, on, economic, migration, to, establish, legal, channels, for, entry, and, to, foster, an, integration, policy, based, on, respect, for, rights, and, equal, treatment, of, both, local, and, migrant, workers, as, a, key, tool, to, address, the, social, impact, of, migration, flows, the, eu, should, attract, the, world, 's, most, talented, and, most, entrepreneurial, there, was, an, attempt, to, reform, the, blue, card, directive, by, the, junker, commission, in, order, to, create, a, new, streamlined, eu, wide, visa, category, similar, to, the, short, lived, schengen, visa, the, holder, of, the, new, blue, card, like, visa, would, have, the, entire, eu, labor, market, at, their, disposal, the, eu, has, for, too, long, seen, a, net, exodus, or, brain, drain, of, highly, qualified, people, compared, to, most, anglophone, countries, europe, has, been, quite, timid, in, attracting, talent, across, the, globe, too, few, people, know, of, and, make, use, of, the, eu, blue, card, the, eu, is, a, destination, of, choice, for, migration, and, refugees, from, developing, and, some, neighboring, countries, the, future, is, work, mobility, thus, we, need, to, simplify, taxation, enhance, remote, working, opportunities, and, enable, inter, country, recruitment, for, companies, many, migrants, simply, refuse, to, fight, to, change, things, in, their, own, countries, once, a, migrant, told, me, i, want, what, you, have, why, should, i, sweat, to, build, it, back, in, my, country, when, here, it, 's, ready, to, be, taken, no, thanks, if, we, need, work, force, we, should, look, for, europeans, to, come, not, for, afrikans, arabic, and, muslims, people, born, in, africa, or, poor, countries, look, for, a, better, place, for, their, kids, to, grow, up, where, there, is, no, war, and, where, there, is, food, good, education, and, health, systems, promoting, organizing, and, directing, mass, migration, is, a, crime, against, humanity, lukashenko, is, currently, committing, exactly, this, heinous, crime, but, so, are, george, soros, and, his, ngos, who, are, engaged, in, the, very, same, hybrid, warfare, against, europe, when, they, bring, those, migrants, to, our, shores, either, the, eu, will, be, a, fortress, against, illegal, migration, or, it, will, not, exist, anymore, in, the, future, europe, is, more, than, rich, enough, to, welcome, many, immigrants, and, if, they, are, permitted, to, work, they, will, even, generate, their, own, income, and, benefits, for, the, country, they, arrive, in, you, are, justifying, the, genocide, of, indigenous, europeans, who, when, asked, always, reject, these, refugees, as, eu, citizens, we, should, never, forget, how, privileged, we, are, and, that, we, bear, a, human, obligation, to, help, others, in, need, it, is, necessary, that, member, states, better, share, the, efforts, of, receiving, asylum, seekers, upon, arrival, at, eu, borders, and, do, not, leave, this, responsibility, to, frontline, countries,   , the, eu, should, develop, a, joint, approach, to, support, the, frontline, countries, to, assure, that, asylum, seeker, are, provided, adequate, care, assistance, and, protection, upon, arrival, and, are, quickly, distributed, evenly, throughout, the, eu, for, status, determination, the, root, causes, to, leave, their, home, countries, should, not, be, overlooked, the, eu, and, its, member, states, need, to, increase, efforts, to, make, the, countries, of, origin, more, liveable, successful, migration, is, only, possible, when, there, is, a, vacancy, in, the, host, country, and, the, migrant, has, the, required, qualifications, unlimited, mass, migration, is, the, greatest, existential, threat, to, the, eu,   , even, more, so, than, the, co2, threat, more, illegal, and, legal, migration, will, lead, to, more, unemployment, lower, wages, more, insecurity, and, less, sustainable, social, systems, respect, for, human, rights, and, effort, sharing, and, solidarity, should, be, common, sense, in, eu, member, states, unfortunately, they, 're, not, yet, i, disagree, each, country, must, be, sovereign, to, establish, its, migration, policy, and, no, eu, quotas, should, be, accepted, across, the, eu, young, people, are, continuing, to, face, a, number, of, significant, challenges, to, enter, and, get, a,   , stable, position, in, the, labor, market, they, do, not, easily, obtain, good, quality, jobs, with, decent, wages, and, are, still, faced, with, significant, exclusion, from, regular, employment, good, quality, education, training, opportunities, as, well, as, adequate, inclusion, and, coverage, in, the, national, social, protection, systems, young, women, and, migrants, are, particularly, affected, so, we, need, a, fairer, migration, policy, but, also, consider, migrant, needs, and, challenges, in, other, policy, areas,  , the, shameful, policy, and, practice, of, europe, these, days, towards, migrants, is, contradictory, to, the, respect, we, need, to, show, to, fellow, world, citizens, and, it, is, not, in, line, with, the, fundamental, rights, the, eu, is, supposed, to, put, into, practice, in, the, eu, labor, market, we, will, need, more, workers, from, outside, europe, to, continue, the, level, of, economic, activities, we, are, planning, there, is, a, need, for, a, balance, between, solidarity, and, responsibility, a, reform, of, the, dublin, system, is, needed, but, the, revision, work, has, not, moved, an, inch, since, 2019, there, have, been, attempts, of, making, progress, in, adopting, a, common, european, asylum, system, and, forming, an, eu, wide, resettlement, system, with, sufficient, financial, incentives, while, also, stressing, its, aim, to, closely, monitor, migration, routes, and, maintain, situational, awareness, this, issue, should, be, enhanced, on, a, european, level, as, we, never, know, when, there, will, be, a, new, crisis, at, our, hands, this, time, caused, by, climate, change, and, environmental, disasters, forcing, people, to, go, into, diaspora, and, search, for, a, safe, haven,  , the, eu, should, treat, economic, migrants, with, more, vigilance, they, can, not, be, the, solution, to, the, aging, european, population, we, need, more, focus, on, border, control, to, curb, illegal, migration, the, human, rights, based, approach, should, be, the, core, principle, legal, channels, for, entry, and, fostering, an, integration, policy, based, on, respect, for, rights, and, equal, treatment, of, both, local, and, migrant, workers, as, key, tools, to, address, the, social, impact, of, migration, flows, are, necessary, migrant, workers, are, overrepresented, in, the, most, precarious, jobs, they, are, too, often, underpaid, they, work, under, intolerable, working, conditions, and, live, in, horrendous, housing, facilities, workers, are, vulnerable, to, abuse, and, exploitation, and, they, continue, to, encounter, inhumane, working, and, living, conditions, because, effective, enforcement, is, lacking, trade, unions, are, often, not, allowed, on, worksites, with, precarious, jobs, and, migrant, workers, can, therefore, not, adequately, be, informed, about, their, labor, and, trade, union, rights, third, country, nationals, are, even, more, vulnerable, than, eu, migrant, mobile, workers, although, there, is, an, immense, increase, in, the, number, of, tcn, migrant, workers, there, is, no, adequate, policy, in, protecting, their, rights, anyone, in, europe, should, be, entitled, to, the, same, worker, ’s, rights, no, matter, where, they, come, from, as, migration, is, an, issue, that, is, dealt, with, by, all, countries, we, must, find, a, common, answer, at, the, eu, level, the, dublin, agreement, leaves, eu, member, states, with, an, external, border, completely, alone, to, deal, with, the, challenge, of, immigration, this, must, stop, not, only, because, solidarity, in, the, eu, is, important, for, its, cohesion, but, also, because, the, inevitable, overburdening, of, states, left, alone, with, this, challenge, creates, intolerable, situations, for, the, refugees, before, we, focus, on, ensuring, that, immigrants, have, nice, conditions, in, the, eu, we, should, first, focus, on, ensuring, that, our, own, people, can, live, respected, lives, in, their, own, countries, countries, where, they, paid, taxes, and, supported, with, their, own, labor, so, that, they, are, supported, when, they, get, ill, when, they, need, help, taking, care, of, their, kids, and, when, they, one, day, retire, eu, still, has, n't, properly, managed, to, achieve, this, in, all, member, states, as, such, those, member, states, should, focus, on, repairing, and, improving, the, situation, for, their, own, people, first, and, once, those, countries, are, up, to, standard, and, have, free, resources, left, then, we, can, speak, of, improving, the, situation, for, immigrants, each, country, must, have, the, right, to, choose, based, on, a, democratic, vote, how, many, immigrants, they, want, to, accept,   , the, question, of, immigrants, depends, on, each, country, 's, reality, and, culture, this, must, be, managed, at, the, local, level, we, should, not, bring, the, problem, to, europe, but, we, should, rather, help, where, it, is, needed, in, their, region, giving, immigrants, more, rights, will, lead, to, the, forced, displacement, and, eventual, erasure, of, indigenous, europeans, this, is, criminal, if, what, 's, happening, to, the, uyghurs, and, tibetans, in, china, is, genocide, then, so, is, this, this, idea, proposal, is, not, grassroots, it, 's, astroturfed, lies, to, hide, the, fact, that, our, migration, policies, are, totally, undemocratic, and, forced, onto, native, europeans, a, fair, sustainable, and, open, europe, benefits, everyone,   , our, common, future, demands, actions, to, put, human, rights, solidarity, and, social, justice, on, top, of, the, agenda, the, nations, must, have, the, final, say, regarding, whom, they, want, to, allow, to, live, on, their, sovereign, territories, mass, immigration, is, the, biggest, existential, threat, to, the, eu,   , the, unchr, has, already, 70, million, registered, refugees, mainly, from, africa, and, the, me, in, africa, 400, million, like, to, come, to, the, eu,   , almost, all, people, are, without, a, useful, education,   , there, is, no, other, solution, than, an, almost, total, stop, to, immigration, agreed, but, only, on, one, condition, that, every, euro, be, spent, under, the, joint, control, of, local, and, european, officers, there, 's, so, much, corruption, in, africa, that, otherwise, of, every, 100, euros, sent, there, at, least, 80, would, end, up, in, the, pockets, of, corrupt, officers, and, in, that, case, it, 's, better, to, not, send, anything, the, european, union, should, be, a, haven, of, togetherness, and, humanity, the, migration, pressure, from, africa, towards, europe, results, from, a, significant, difference, in, perceived, quality, of, life, it, is, in, the, interest, of, the, eu, and, its, member, states, to, reduce, that, difference, by, working, with, the, au, to, level, up, and, develop, african, nations, yes, and, it, should, be, payed, out, to, every, citizen, of, the, eu, those, people, with, a, lower, co2, footprint, typically, lower, income, family, would, greatly, benefit, from, it, and, be, incentivized, to, invest, in, cleaner, energy, heating, etc, esperanto, should, be, promoted, as, an, international, lingua, franca, esperanto, is, an, efficient, and, expressive, means, of, cross, cultural, communication, allowing, high, degrees, of, inclusion, give, those, who, want, to, come, a, fair, secure, possibility, to, do, so, send, those, back, who, really, damage, your, society, give, training, support, opportunities, my, guess, is, that, most, will, pay, back, with, their, contributions, we, already, have, successful, programs, for, students, from, refugee, camps, enhance, that, yes, though, some, countries, have, other, problems, right, now, give, member, states, the, possibility, to, choose, more, refugees, more, money, support, or, less, refugees, less, money, support, very, simple, take, as, example, airplanes, how, so, that, it, is, so, common, to, be, able, to, search, for, tickets, using, one, of, many, webpages, or, apps, but, we, actually, can, not, do, the, same, for, trains, trains, are, more, ecological, if, we, do, have, an, eu, citizenship, we, will, have, an, eu, country, and, eu, already, proved, to, be, no, good, dealing, with, problems, and, is, extremely, undemocratic, and, not, listening, to, the, people, there, are, countries, like, greece, to, which, to, my, knowledge, is, no, train, connection, from, other, eu, countries, at, all, that, should, be, a, top, priority, for, the, eu, this, would, help, to, plan, the, most, efficient, and, economical, itinerary, yes, but, the, tax, should, be, progressive, per, capita, this, will, ensure, that, we, tax, mostly, overuse, of, resources, and, avoid, increasing, wealth, inequality, of, the, poor, agreed, only, if, we, show, that, criminals, do, n't, have, a, place, in, the, eu, we, can, convince, our, citizens, that, refugees, are, n't, that, much, of, a, threat, making, the, checking, process, that, each, refugee, has, to, go, through, public, would, also, help, to, get, rid, of, the, feeling, that, anyone, can, just, come, here, and, we, need, to, close, our, borders, why, should, every, country, in, the, eu, be, sovereign, in, energy, production, within, the, countries, also, not, every, region, is, sovereign, in, this, sense, we, need, to, take, advantage, of, the, geographic, potentials, of, the, european, continent, for, pragmatic, solutions, not, only, for, committing, but, also, planning, especially, if, an, immigrant, gets, caught, planning, a, terrorist, act, he, she, must, be, removed, from, eu, permanently, most, experts, agree, that, an, eu, wide, carbon, tax, would, be, an, efficient, way, to, curb, our, co2, emissions, in, my, point, of, view, it, will, be, essential, to, impose, some, compensatory, levies, on, products, from, third, countries, to, ensure, that, they, will, not, have, a, competitive, advantage, eventually, the, best, solution, would, be, a, world, wide, agreement, as, within, oecd, and, like, minded, such, as, the, global, minimum, tax, rate, absolutely, right, if, the, eurocrats, cared, about, what, the, people, want, they, 'd, ask, them, cheap, and, accessible, train, travel, brings, everyone, closer, together, regardless, of, borders, we, should, think, of, more, opportunities, to, enter, the, eu, legally, many, people, come, illegally, because, we, refuse, them, opportunities, to, come, stay, a, while, for, work, or, education, and, maybe, go, back, later, people, die, because, of, that, nonsense, i, recently, read, that, especially, african, families, tend, to, send, their, smartest, best, educated, youngsters, abroad, to, improve, the, family, situation, these, people, are, desperately, needed, both, for, the, future, of, their, home, countries, and, for, our, future, we, need, skilled, educated, people, in, many, sectors, but, sends, such, people, back, to, their, home, countries, because, they, were, unfortunate, enough, to, be, refugees, it, has, to, work, like, with, air, travel, book, a, coherent, journey, from, a, to, b, operated, by, different, companies, and, be, sure, that, if, something, goes, wrong, there, will, be, a, solution, rebooking, nuclear, energy, is, not, green, because, of, radioactive, waste, i, agree, no, one, should, migrate, to, a, country, if, they, 're, going, to, commit, a, crime, nuclear, energy, simply, is, too, expensive, and, hence, economically, not, viable, according, to, the, researchers, at, rethinkx, we, will, see, a, clean, energy, disruption, in, the, next, ten, years, which, will, leave, investments, in, oil, coal, and, nuclear, stranded, africa, and, the, middle, east, have, the, highest, birthrate, in, the, world, africa, has, up, to, 7, children, per, woman, the, eu, has, 1,55,   , it, is, this, high, birthrate, that, keeps, them, poor, there, is, almost, nothing, the, eu, can, do, about, it, the, eu, is, not, responsible, for, the, entire, world, all, refugee, camps, should, be, closed, and, illegals, moved, back, to, the, last, country, they, left, helping, migrants, learn, the, language, and, culture, of, the, country, they, are, living, in, are, critical, to, successful, integration, language, and, norms, of, the, job, market, and, workplace, should, also, be, built, in, africa, is, the, only, continent, where, the, number, of, young, people, continues, to, increase, discussing, what, happened, in, the, past, between, africa, and, europe, is, useless, all, slaves, and, their, owners, died, a, long, time, ago, you, can, not, blame, the, grandchildren, if, there, are, language, problems, we, need, to, work, on, national, integration, systems, e.g., in, france, where, english, is, being, thought, in, french, language, we, have, already, english, as, a, language, of, exchange, english, is, ideal, as, it, is, spoken, internationally, as, the, language, of, commerce, travel, and, political, exchange, esperanto, is, n't, migration, is, part, of, being, human, and, has, always, happened, throughout, history,    , the, eu, needs, a, humane, civilized, and, legal, way, to, manage, migration, whether, it, is, for, economic, reasons, or, to, seek, international, protection, the, eu, member, states, need, to, lift, together, instead, of, trying, to, push, the, burdens, onto, each, other, or, external, nations, we, need, to, accept, more, immigrants, to, combat, the, aging, of, the, european, population, immigrants, do, also, grow, old, but, before, then, they, generally, have, children, paying, taxes, is, not, enough, if, you, want, to, become, a, citizen, with, full, rights, you, need, to, fully, embrace, the, country, you, live, in, if, young, europeans, are, living, abroad, they, will, feel, racism, on, their, own, in, the, country, they, are, living, in, no, duck, would, like, to, live, with, eagles, or, sparrows,   , that, 's, nature, not, wishful, thinking, migrants, have, a, complete, lack, of, critical, thinking,  , migrants, willingly, risk, their, lives, migrants, depend, on, other, countries, social, systems, migrants, sell, drugs, the, eu, should, acknowledge, the, fact, that, increasing, birth, rates, in, europe, and, supporting, european, families, to, have, more, children, is, the, most, appropriate, long, term, solution, for, increasing, the, birthrate, and, supporting, young, families, hungary, should, be, an, example, we, should, not, rely, on, migration, for, this, the, emphasis, on, negative, stereotypes, towards, migrants, comes, mostly, from, people, who, do, n't, know, africans, or, other, migrants, or, refugees, migrants, have, an, enormous, amount, to, offer, in, energy, new, ideas, and, cultures, why, this, emphasis, on, imaginary, takeovers, if, asylum, applications, are, filed, from, abroad, the, costs, for, eu, taxpayers, to, handle, asylum, seekers, are, reduced, if, asylum, applications, are, filed, from, abroad, the, humanitarian, crisis, in, the, mediterranean, sea, is, ended, if, asylum, applications, are, filed, from, abroad, the, security, risks, for, asylum, seekers, are, greatly, reduced, mass, migration, is, hybrid, warfare, directed, against, our, stability, state, actors, such, as, morocco, belarus, and, turkey, have, already, taken, advantage, of, mass, migration, mass, migration, is, hybrid, warfare, directed, against, our, stability, ngos, organize, finance, and, promote, migration, to, get, advantages, migration, has, totally, gotten, out, of, control, the, eu, refuses, to, see, the, magnitude, of, it, hundreds, of, millions, like, to, migrate, all, people, without, the, right, language, and, fitting, education, the, massive, numbers, of, immigrants, threaten, the, existence, of, eu, societies, through, crime, poverty, and, housing, shortage,   , refugees, can, obtain, a, visa, at, an, embassy, in, one, of, the, 54, african, countries, all, other, immigrants, must, be, returned, within, a, week, of, arrival, there, are, memberstaates, in, the, european, union, that, do, not, want, any, asylum, seekers, in, their, country, for, example, denmark, sends, back, all, syrens, and, other, arabians, fear, of, the, unknown, is, normal, behavior, it, has, saved, our, race, since, ages, starting, when, mankind, was, a, simple, monkey, among, others, additionally, when, fear, is, reinforced, by, facts, like, increased, violence, in, every, country, with, a, high, number, of, immigrants, and, rapes, of, women, it, is, not, a, problem, of, perception, but, a, simple, reality, halt, all, immigration, from, non, european, or, non, first, world, countries, into, the, eu, instead, of, trying, to, stop, immigration, we, need, to, create, a, good, integration, plan, and, at, the, same, time, improve, living, conditions, in, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, world, countries, this, includes, fighting, for, climate, justice, and, decreasing, unequal, wealth, distribution, between, countries, there, need, to, be, some, rules, for, integration, integration, does, not, mean, giving, up, european, values, and, culture, there, need, to, be, some, rules, for, integration, integration, does, not, mean, completely, open, borders, i, am, happy, to, see, that, the, ide, of, haling, all, immigration, from, non, european, or, non, first, world, countries, is, still, going, strong, this, message, needs, to, be, communicated, to, brussels, very, clearly, no, more, non, european, immigration, the, native, europeans, have, said, no, european, citizens, are, the, future, of, europe, just, arguing, to, keep, migrants, out, is, very, shortsighted, and, unhistorical, by, keeping, migrants, out, migration, pressure, will, not, abate, so, what, do, you, suggest, for, next, year, 10, years, from, now,  , migration, has, been, a, fact, of, history, and, successful, societies, have, found, ways, to, turn, migration, into, strength, in, our, case, in, order, to, alleviate, the, current, challenge, in, the, long, term, we, need, to, alleviate, migration, pressure, by, making, it, attractive, for, migrants, to, stay, put, and, help, develop, their, own, countries, such, a, helpful, project, a, european, marshal, plan, for, africa, would, be, a, good, project, to, invest, in, the, long, term, return, on, investment, would, be, more, than, financial, a, friendly, neighbor, continent, good, relationships, access, to, the, african, market, and, natural, resources, that, is, not, a, short, term, fix, and, there, is, no, short, term, fix, we, have, to, play, the, long, game, why, ca, n't, arab, countries, shelter, refugees, from, other, arab, countries, same, habits, religion, and, they, have, enough, wealth, his, is, the, issue, in, politics, and, public, sector, policy, making, no, objectives, are, to, be, pursued, no, problems, to, be, solved, i, guess, it, is, the, nature, of, the, beast, balancing, conflicting, interests, a, humanitarian, association, that, helps, a, migrant, to, enter, the, eu, illegally, should, lose, its, government, eu, funding, we, should, halt, all, immigration, from, non, european, or, non, first, world, countries, into, the, eu, however, if, we, want, to, stop, this, immigration, we, must, stop, its, causes, indeed, it, is, war, poverty, and, european, chinese, and, american, neo, colonialism, that, make, the, people, of, african, and, middle, eastern, countries, flee, to, europe, so, europe, must, finally, take, responsibility, and, protect, these, countries, from, corruption, war, and, neo, colonialism, and, help, them, to, start, their, economy, migration, from, countries, with, incompatible, cultural, values, and, ideologies, should, be, limited, or, stopped, to, ensure, social, cohesion, in, europe, regressive, outdated, ideologies, and, values, should, have, no, place, in, europe, the, migrants, that, are, already, legally, here, should, be, taught, western, values, so, they, and, their, families, can, integrate, assimilate, as, the, age, old, saying, goes, when, in, rome, do, as, the, romans, do, what, we, are, now, seeing, are, the, first, waves, of, a, human, tsunami, in, sub, saharan, africa, over, years, the, population, will, have, grown, to, 2,0, billion,   , that, is, more, than, the, people, who, live, in, the, eu, and, us, today,   , at, the, same, time, the, population, in, the, eu, is, shrinking, when, we, keep, the, border, open, the, eu, as, a, viable, society, will, disappear,   , not, much, of, a, future, for, the, young, europeans, entering, the, eu, without, a, permit, automatically, excludes, a, person, from, any, right, to, receive, asylum, we, must, stop, all, loopholes, for, example, automatically, rejecting, asylum, claims, of, anyone, who, enters, europe, illegally, in, conclusion, we, should, say, europeans, go, home, go, home, leave, every, part, of, the, world, where, we, are, making, business, exploiting, cheap, labor, rare, minerals, selling, arms, invading, foreign, countries, and, exporting, democracy, etc, the, demographic, problems, for, the, eu, which, are, real, must, be, solved, by, encouraging, child, bearing, and, a, generous, family, policy, not, through, migration, we, must, celebrate, motherhood, and, moms, we, must, realize, that, raising, a, child, involves, serious, costs, in, today, 's, europe, multiculturalism, creates, chaos, wherever, it, exists, sweden, 's, stockholm, has, become, the, rape, capital, of, the, west, and, the, number, of, bombs, and, shootings, has, skyrocketed, as, well, in, that, country, france, is, bordering, on, civil, war, whole, territories, are, not, under, state, control, anymore, europe, needs, to, stop, migration, and, asylum, indefinitely, we, need, to, put, our, european, peoples, first, much, like, the, entire, world, is, doing, while, our, civilization, is, committing, suicide, based, on, values, imposed, by, sanctimonious, narcissists, there, 's, nothing, wrong, with, not, wanting, your, continent, to, become, chaos, and, putting, your, people, first, every, civilization, in, this, world, takes, that, idea, as, self, evident, we, need, to, negotiate, remigration, deals, with, the, 3rd, countries, to, send, their, nationals, back, and, we, need, to, use, frontex, to, push, back, any, migrants, coming, to, our, borders, the, eu, leadership, fails, to, carry, out, its, fundamental, duties, guard, its, border, and, protect, its, own, people, even, 30, years, after, schengen, was, introduced, immigration, should, not, be, part, of, humanitarian, aid, humanitarian, aid, should, be, delivered, directly, to, africa, asia, the, turkey, deal, should, eventually, be, abolished, europe, must, stay, europe, and, people, must, not, be, imposed, a, cultural, and, religious, change, they, do, not, want, and, which, is, insane, look, at, what, the, arabic, or, north, african, countries, have, become, after, 1400, years, of, islam, a, humanitarian, association, that, helps, a, migrant, to, enter, the, eu, illegally, should, be, required, to, provide, financial, support, in, dignified, conditions, a, humanitarian, association, that, helps, a, migrant, to, enter, the, eu, illegally, should, also, be, dragged, in, front, of, the, court, for, not, taking, the, illegals, to, the, closest, safe, port, in, 90, of, the, cases, the, closest, port, lies, in, africa, we, need, to, stop, all, funding, to, ngos, and, all, migration, organizations, within, the, eu, then, can, we, talk, about, how, to, help, the, people, already, here, and, how, to, help, real, people, in, need, we, need, to, agree, that, people, who, do, not, respect, our, immigration, law, are, detained, in, centers, for, repatriation, the, country, of, origin, should, absolutely, be, the, most, important, criterion, for, deciding, who, we, let, into, our, countries, 160, frenchman, would, still, be, alive, if, we, put, the, welfare, of, our, own, above, people, whose, countries, the, americans, have, bombed, to, shreds,   , it, is, time, to, be, honest, about, this, europeans, have, the, right, to, self, determination, like, every, other, country, out, there, this, is, our, home, and, a, home, for, everyone, is, a, home, for, no, one, our, europe, continent, is, in, debt, and, does, n't, have, the, resources, to, care, for, people, who, have, never, paid, taxes, and, continue, to, disregard, our, laws, we, have, enough, poor, people, in, europe, already, and, we, need, to, take, care, of, them, i, do, not, agree, with, stripping, people, of, their, right, to, asylum, and, a, right, to, live, in, the, eu, because, they, came, illegally, i, would, instead, suggest, making, it, easier, to, migrate, legally, that, way, there, would, be, no, need, to, migrate, illegally, and, risk, your, life, while, doing, so, the, dividing, of, refugees, is, a, long, discussed, plan, but, in, the, end, no, involved, group, agreed, with, these, plans, some, countries, do, not, like, these, people, at, all, europe, is, full, and, can, not, accept, more, illegal, migrants, those, persons, must, be, sent, back, and, have, to, ask, for, approval, from, their, state, of, origin, we, are, europeans, this, is, not, racism, but, we, do, n't, support, growth, if, we, accept, many, immigrants, then, we, make, a, huge, stop, in, the, growth, of, the, migrant, countries, because, i, am, 100, sure, that, they, will, never, ever, go, back, to, their, country, what, are, you, 5, and, what, do, you, mean, by, first, world, should, we, create, a, task, force, just, to, understand, what, countries, are, to, be, considered, the, first, world, is, it, the, money, the, religion, the, food, their, political, system, and, then, reevaluate, each, year, this, comment, is, plain, ignorant, the, proposal, of, the, sardines, to, reform, eu, asylum, policy, is, an, excellent, proposal, well, and, thoroughly, written, the, key, to, successful, immigration, depends, upon, the, possibility, of, employment,   , so, eu, members, are, to, decide, whom, they, want, to, admit,  , illegal, immigrants, have, to, be, returned, to, un, refugee, camps,   , i, have, no, trouble, with, non, western, immigrants,   , i, have, trouble, with, mass, immigration,   , what, happens, is, when, they, come, in, large, numbers, they, do, not, integrate, anymore,   , they, stick, to, themselves, and, become, a, new, tribe, that, tries, to, change, their, host, country, if, you, want, migrants, invite, them, into, your, home, turkey, is, an, enemy, it, uses, this, deal, to, make, a, threat, stop, it, now, and, send, patrols, to, the, greek, border, or, welcome, them, this, is, just, evidence, immigration, will, be, one, of, the, most, difficult, topics, in, the, next, decades, or, even, years, due, to, the, insane, demographic, rates, the, world, is, suffering, nowadays, so, immigration, has, to, be, closely, monitored, and, all, illegal, immigration, has, to, be, blocked, the, eu, needs, to, establish, a, legal, means, of, preventing, illegal, migration, that, is, encouraged, by, the, turkish, government, and, by, privately, funded, ngos, which, are, acting, against, the, interest, of, the, eu, what, does, legal, migration, look, like, people, can, only, ask, for, asylum, from, within, the, eu, and, must, officially, do, so, at, the, point, of, entry, this, has, caused, inhumane, circumstances, as, we, see, at, camp, moria, in, greece, what, does, legal, migration, look, like, people, can, not, ask, for, asylum, at, an, embassy, or, consulate, so, people, actually, have, to, come, to, the, eu, and, enter, the, eu, if, they, want, to, ask, for, asylum, in, the, eu, this, has, caused, inhumane, and, dangerous, circumstances, as, we, see, in, the, mediterranean, sea, we, do, need, migrants, from, an, ethical, and, practical, point, of, view, europe, is, old, and, archaic, in, most, of, its, practices, innovation, is, failing, and, the, best, we, can, do, is, defend, the, status, quo, and, the, old, people, in, power,   , but, also, those, people, who, fear, migrants, thinking, they, are, all, criminals, while, 99, of, them, are, people, coming, to, work, improving, their, family, 's, life, and, paying, taxes, will, need, someone, to, pay, their, retirement, benefits/, pensions, and, to, push, their, wheelchairs, without, the, refugee, deal, the, migrants, will, return, to, invade, us, it, is, absurd, that, such, an, eu, policy, about, migration, is, lacking,  , the, eu, is, driving, in, the, dark, with, the, lights, switch, off, nonsense, mass, migration, is, a, crime, against, humanity,   , endorse, this, idea, no, more, immigration, from, non, european, or, non, first, world, countries, the, eu, can, not, be, heaven, for, the, entire, world, the, reality, requires, that, refugees, must, be, stopped, at, the, border, and, receive, only, temporary, shelter,   , the, number, is, simply, too, big, to, give, anyone, free, housing, free, living, free, education, free, medicare, and, a, free, pension, anybody, arguing, else, is, completely, out, of, touch, with, reality, europe, should, look, at, the, european, people, first, it, is, not, fair, for, the, working, classes, to, have, to, live, within, the, ruins, of, multiculturalism, while, the, middle, class, supports, immigration, from, within, their, gated, communities, immigration, is, a, class, issue, at, the, same, time, integration, is, important, those, against, this, policy, should, be, made, to, send, their, children, to, multicultural, schools, in, order, to, help, with, integration, marvelous, to, see, this, idea, of, halting, immigration, receive, the, most, endorsements, on, the, migration, topic, this, is, really, not, going, according, to, plan, for, the, globalists, complex, problems, are, faced, by, deepening, study, not, by, pretending, they, do, n't, exist, whenever, you, find, yourself, in, crisis, and, the, eu, is, in, crisis, it, is, a, good, idea, to, return, to, core, business, and, in, the, case, of, the, eu, the, core, business, is, economy, trade, and, security, that, 's, where, the, focus, should, be, the, more, dynamic, the, economy, the, stronger, the, innovation, and, worldwide, influence, the, eu, will, have, including, soft, power, the, covid-19, pandemic, showed, us, that, the, european, union, is, not, able, to, come, up, with, technological, innovations, that, could, strengthen, our, economic, position, the, eu, has, some, rules, on, how, social, security, systems, are, coordinated, regulation, 883/2004, ec, eu, rules, ensure, that, the, pension, rights, accrued, in, each, country, are, added, together, and, paid, out, by, the, pension, insurance, institution, of, the, member, state, of, affiliation, but, the, bureaucratic, nightmare, is, probably, just, as, guaranteed,   , a, better, solution, would, be, a, transparent, and, digital, platform, that, collects, pension, entitlements, from, all, eu, member, states, that, way, every, citizen, would, have, an, overview, of, his, or, her, pension, entitlements, at, all, times, not, just, until, when, they, are, due, the, standardized, retirement, age, would, not, only, be, fairer, in, an, open, market, but, it, would, also, and, even, more, so, in, the, future, prevent, any, complexities, with, being, paid, their, retirement, for, those, who, have, made, their, contributions, in, different, member, states, throughout, their, lives, even, though, there, is, to, be, at, least, a, central, system, for, this, a, step, in, the, right, direction, one, will, only, receive, a, share, of, one, 's, retirement, from, a, particular, member, state, once, one, reaches, the, retirement, age, of, that, member, state, bad, governance, unreasonable, spending, and, corruption, are, damaging, and, unsustainable, which, means, we, ca, n't, afford, to, leave, them, alone, if, we, want, to, have, a, future, the, eu, needs, to, focus, on, simplifying, and, standardizing, european, processes, and, procedures, associated, with, public, management, and, creating, efficient, and, effective, anti, corruption, mechanisms, this, will, reduce, the, financial, resources, to, be, made, available, to, the, most, relevant, areas, of, intervention, at, the, eu, country, and, regional, levels, there, is, a, reason, why, these, states, do, n't, want, to, join, the, common, currency, their, economies, are, more, flexible, and, doing, far, better, without, it, if, we, really, want, more, countries, to, start, using, the, euro, we, need, to, make, the, euro, better, not, pressure, or, force, others, into, our, inefficient, system, i, find, it, distressing, and, unreasonable, to, force, an, individual, to, leave, behind, their, hard, earned, pension, pot, there, should, be, a, mechanism, that, stops, this, practice, just, as, i, can, move, myself, my, family, furniture, car, and, bank, accounts, freely, within, the, eu, i, should, have, the, same, right, to, move, and, merge, my, pensions, into, a, single, unit, retirement, is, often, funded, by, taxes, and, taxes, are, decided, by, each, member, state, so, each, member, state, should, also, be, the, one, who, decides, how, those, taxes, are, spent, for, some, countries, a, retirement, age, of, 65, may, be, unaffordable, or, undesirable, while, for, others, it, may, not, the, covid, crisis, has, shown, that, we, are, very, vulnerable,   , critical, industries, must, stay, in, europe, infrastructure, in, the, eu, especially, critical, infrastructure, must, remain, under, full, and, absolute, european, control, it, will, bring, the, eu, more, jobs, less, unemployment, and, more, added, value, there, are, languages, that, are, spoken, by, fewer, people, and, are, official, the, european, parliament, in, its, current, form, is, completely, inadequate, at, representing, the, interests, of, all, citizens, including, the, labor, force, i, can, not, agree, to, give, it, more, power, until, it, is, ensured, that, the, meps, are, more, responsive, to, their, constituents, electing, them, from, individual, election, districts, not, lists, and, reducing, their, mandate, to, 2, 3, years, would, be, a, good, first, step, real, democracy, can, not, do, without, economic, democracy, if, the, major, decisions, about, our, future, life, investments, inventions, production, are, made, outside, social, control, then, there, is, no, real, democracy,   , without, proper, social, consultation, there, is, no, prospect, for, a, fair, europe, the, undemocratic, nature, and, perception, of, the, presidency, and, the, commission, were, used, very, effectively, during, the, brexit, referendum, campaign, to, change, the, minds, of, even, the, most, reasonable, pro, eu, and, anti, brexit, voters, as, eu, political, representatives, were, already, remote, and, inaccessible, to, many, people, with, unrecognized, names, faces, and, campaign, points, having, leaders, with, great, power, across, europe, that, nobody, directly, voted, for, is, of, great, concern, unless, the, eu, radically, democratizes, the, presidency, creating, the, position, which, failed, several, referenda, as, well, as, the, commission, it, will, be, used, again, and, again, to, stoke, anti, eu, sentiment, as, we, are, transitioning, into, a, more, extensive, digital, age, every, day, we, still, should, not, forget, that, as, we, age, it, gets, harder, to, be, quick, with, digital, news, information, and, advances, in, society, therefore, even, right, now, our, current, older, generations, and, future, older, generations, need, a, physical, touch, point, where, competent, people, would, be, able, to, introduce, on, the, spot, what, that, one, person, as, a, citizen, of, the, european, union, can, do, that, exact, day, to, influence, the, benefit, of, europe, and, their, country, we, need, to, strengthen, citizens, trust, in, the, european, project, this, requires, more, transparency, and, accountability, in, particular, when, it, comes, to, access, to, documents, and, democratic, decision, making, the, better, regulation, approach, of, the, commission, which, focuses, on, cutting, costs, and, burdens, prioritizes, business, interests, over, general, interests, and, should, be, abandoned, the, european, project, needs, to, benefit, the, many, and, not, the, few, in, order, to, promote, european, peace, prosperity, and, precious, diversity, a, different, administration, system, is, needed, a, federal, europe, based, on, a, democratic, federal, constitution, instead, of, anarchy, provoking, eu, treaties, catalonia, must, become, independent, from, the, spanish, dictatorial, repression, that, tries, to, end, the, catalan, language, and, culture, no, if, the, parliament, was, given, free, rein, to, start, taxing, people, directly, they, would, of, course, abuse, this, power, to, fund, their, own, pet, projects, because, meps, want, to, feel, important, and, increase, their, own, power, above, all, else, it, 's, good, that, the, member, states, via, council, decisions, can, explicitly, decide, the, size, of, the, eu, budget, and, until, the, democratic, deficit, and, other, systemic, problems, in, the, eu, are, fixed, it, 's, good, that, the, budget, is, kept, at, 1, 2, of, the, total, eu, gdp, we, need, a, real, and, effective, european, democracy, therefore, a, european, federation, first, we, should, empower, people, more, put, an, emphasis, on, education, and, build, a, control, mechanism, for, internet, propaganda, e.g., force, transparency, on, which, content, is, truly, human, and, which, is, sponsored, or, created, by, organizations, and, companies, second, we, should, criminalize, deliberate, misinformation, properly, third, we, should, restructure, the, representation, of, people, in, the, european, union, after, all, the, above, mentioned, we, can, think, about, establishing, a, more, binding, role, of, petitions, to, the, european, parliament, the, language, barrier, and, a, weak, influence, on, local, thinking, allow, local, propaganda, to, pass, on, distorted, and, untrue, information, about, what, is, happening, in, the, eu, to, their, citizens, local, governments, have, easy, work, to, appropriate, the, positive, things, that, the, eu, has, achieved, and, conversely, seduce, its, own, failure, on, european, bureaucracy, in, other, words, eu, taxpayer)-sponsored, propaganda, we, must, move, towards, full, co, decision, power, for, the, european, parliament, and, the, abolition, of, unanimity, for, climate, energy, social, affairs, and, taxation, policies, there, is, a, lack, of, security, and, defense, policy, that, can, realistically, be, achieved, by, strengthening, the, euro, body, as, the, 28th, european, army, directly, electing, the, president, of, the, commission, makes, the, most, susceptible, to, political, sway, which, would, kill, the, commission, as, a, body, of, technical, experts,  , how, would, the, candidates, be, selected, one, per, country, that, just, makes, it, a, tight, race, between, the, two, countries, with, the, largest, population, assuming, one, vote, per, person, why, would, e.g., a, greek, person, vote, for, a, swedish, candidate, how, would, even, a, swedish, candidate, campaign, in, such, a, way, as, to, appeal, to, greek, voters, europe, was, composed, of, 13, countries, in, 1870, and, 23, in, 1914, maybe, it, 's, time, to, change, borders, without, bloodshed, in, germany, the, president, of, the, executive, is, not, elected, by, the, people, directly, either, the, reason, for, this, is, the, horrible, experience, during, the, third, reich, the, parliament, as, the, only, constitutional, institution, being, directly, elected, has, a, stronger, stand, if, the, president, is, not, elected, directly, however, i, definitely, support, that, the, parliament, becomes, stronger, and, more, influential, direct, democracy, is, too, open, to, manipulation, by, populists, and, malefactors, via, social, media, a, transparent, representative, democracy, with, a, solid, lid, on, lobbyism, is, to, be, preferred, transparency, is, the, first, key, to, real, democracy, although, today, council, meetings, are, partially, live, streamed, most, of, the, meetings, are, behind, closed, doors, this, is, an, especially, big, problem, with, the, eurogroup, and, eurosummit, which, are, shady, informal, meetings,   , or, think, about, all, the, meetings, between, diplomats, coreper, and, civil, servants, working, groups, and, committees, where, ±90, of, decisions, are, made, for, the, council, to, be, rubberstamped, meetings, that, most, citizens, do, n't, even, know, about, in, order, to, strengthen, democracy, in, the, eu, council, meetings, should, be, open, to, the, public, and, the, press, only, in, open, council, meetings, are, the, ministers, of, the, member, states, forced, to, clearly, state, the, national, interests, they, can, vouch, for, in, relation, to, their, national, partners, and, voters, together, with, the, european, parliament, it, focuses, on, an, open, political, debate, and, decision, making, process, we, live, in, the, xxi, century, we, do, not, want, any, repression, of, peripheries, by, their, state, center, within, the, european, union, we, should, welcome, the, blessing, of, decentralism, and, localism, including, the, self, determination, of, stateless, peoples, and, stronger, autonomies, within, confederal, agreements, if, not, in, europe, where, if, not, now, when, the, only, thing, europeans, do, n’t, do, together, is, politics, this, is, because, national, parties, not, eu, parties, run, the, show, within, and, across, europe, after, 70, years, of, integration, the, eu, lacks, a, european, party, system, capable, of, fostering, a, genuine, transnational, space, of, political, debate, and, dialogue, where, citizens, can, understand, influence, and, participate, in, decision, making, affecting, their, common, interests, as, europeans, this, must, change, the, political, composition, of, the, european, council, and, therefore, the, eu, ’s, political, center, of, gravity, continuously, changes, during, the, eu, political, cycle, thus, preventing, clearer, government, majorities, to, emerge, within, these, two, european, councils,   , national, elections, synchronization, would, finally, make, it, possible, to, strengthen, the, effectiveness, of, the, council, of, the, eu, by, eliminating, the, blockages, caused, by, the, constant, renewal, of, ministers, which, considerably, slows, down, decision, making,  , synchronizing, national, elections, would, allow, european, citizens, to, engage, in, major, pan, european, campaigns, a, direct, election, of, a, european, president, is, a, travesty, of, democracy, it, would, be, only, a, mediatic, competition, among, plastic, leaders,   , something, very, similar, to, the, simulacra, dick, 's, 1964, science, fiction, novel,   , we, are, not, a, nation, we, are, a, confederation, of, nations, decision, making, is, today, made, unilaterally, minding, short, term, economic, interests, and, employers, demands, we, need, a, social, progressive, policy, in, the, eu,   , it, is, also, very, important, that, the, eu, does, not, destroy, national, progressive, labor, laws, and, social, protection, provisions, in, third, party, countries, via, agreements, as, it, tried, with, switzerland, and, the, institutional, framework, agreement, it, would, render, the, meetings, useless, since, they, would, only, be, able, to, express, official, statements, and, instead, negotiate, new, ideas, without, pressure, according, to, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, the, iccpr, a]ll, peoples, have, the, right, of, self, determination, by, virtue, of, that, right, they, freely, determine, their, political, status, and, freely, pursue, their, economic, social, and, cultural, development, the, right, to, self, determination, also, has, its, economic, content, which, gives, the, people, the, right, to, freely, dispose, of, their, natural, wealth, and, resources, without, prejudice, to, any, obligations, arising, out, of, international, economic, cooperation, based, upon, the, principle, of, mutual, benefit, and, international, law, europe, needs, a, proper, parliament, including, a, right, to, initiative, combined, with, strong, involvement, of, social, partners, e.g., through, european, social, dialogue, or, the, partnership, principle, in, regional, funds, high, voter, turnout, is, usually, desirable, but, it, 's, a, symptom, not, the, root, cause, forcing, people, to, go, to, the, polls, does, n't, mean, they, will, make, more, informed, choices, besides, voter, turnout, is, a, good, metric, that, tells, us, where, the, potential, problems, of, voter, disenfranchisement, are, which, is, the, first, step, to, addressing, them, after, so, many, years, so, many, wars, and, so, many, forced, exiles, all, over, europe, and, all, over, the, world, it, may, be, time, to, rectify, our, errors, and, return, the, old, given, rights, to, the, many, national, groups, that, have, been, eliminated, by, force, or, conquest, or, undesired, immigration, there, is, now, a, good, example, of, this, happening, in, ukraine, by, the, russian, occupation, self, determination, is, a, basic, collective, human, right, catalans, practiced, this, right, in, 2017,   , since, then, the, catalan, republic, is, kidnaped, by, spanish, lawfare, with, the, elected, president, puigdemont, in, exile, within, europe, and, more, than, 3000, catalan, activists, suffering, political, persecution, as, a, consequence,   , ignoring, this, conflict, within, the, core, of, europe, by, european, institutions, can, undermine, the, eu, at, its, very, start,   , if, you, sincerely, believe, in, human, rights, recognize, the, catalan, republic, officially, this, crucial, step, will, enforce, european, democracy, the, democracy, of, citizens, that, feel, free, and, respected, within, european, borders, the, attempt, to, shove, the, postmodern, version, of, liberalism, down, europeans, throats, has, contributed, greatly, to, the, current, crisis, of, the, eu, pragmatism, was, in, the, eu, ’s, dna, since, its, inception, but, this, is, sadly, no, longer, the, case, the, current, eu, is, not, a, moral, authority, it, is, a, political, organization, based, on, mutual, interests, and, political, diversity, pragmatism, entails, the, protection, and, promotion, of, european, interests, banning, top, down, ideology, and, respecting, the, cultural, and, political, individuality, of, every, member, state, every, nation, with, its, own, language, and, culture, which, demands, the, same, status, as, a, sovereign, nation, within, europe, must, have, the, right, to, be, recognized, and, respected, by, people, and, other, member, nations, states, no, the, direct, election, of, a, single, leader, by, the, people, gives, too, much, power, to, this, person, and, anyhow, nobody, can, know, another, person, well, enough, look, at, the, usa, the, candidates, for, president, are, not, real, people, but, are, constructed, by, pr, agencies, the, european, commission, has, to, be, independent, it, is, not, allowed, to, take, instructions, from, any, country, lobby, group, or, anyone, else, an, elected, head, of, the, commission, would, make, nonsense, of, the, principle, of, independence, that, is, vital, to, the, trust, in, the, commission, 's, job, he, or, she, would, be, beholden, to, the, group, that, elected, him, or, her, and, make, the, job, impossible, we, all, want, to, see, transparent, democratic, and, value, based, policy, making,   , the, right, to, good, administration, is, embedded, in, the, charter, of, fundamental, rights, and, should, guide, the, eu, 's, actions, there, are, several, international, treaties, including, those, of, the, united, nations, and, those, of, the, european, union, to, which, the, member, states, are, bound, that, recognize, the, right, to, self, determination, of, peoples, unfortunately, the, european, union, does, not, provide, any, sufficient, and, appropriate, mechanism, in, order, to, allow, the, citizens, and, the, peoples, of, the, union, i.e., individually, and, collectively, to, enjoy, that, right, i, thus, approve, and, endorse, the, proposal, for, a, clarity, mechanism, on, the, right, to, self, determination, within, the, european, union, facilitating, an, internal, enlargement, process, for, greater, subsidiarity, the, right, for, stateless, nations, and, peoples, to, democratically, decide, on, their, own, future, must, be, respected, and, for, that, purpose, we, advocate, for, the, creation, of, a, mechanism, of, clarity, at, the, eu, level, aimed, at, facilitating, and, resolving, any, eventual, self, determination, disputes, through, democratic, means, this, tool, should, ensure, that, positions, can, not, be, imposed, nor, debates, prevented, in, a, democracy, people, have, the, right, to, decide, on, any, issue, that, affects, their, lives, if, more, than, half, of, the, inhabitants, of, a, region, want, to, form, an, independent, state, they, have, the, right, to, do, so, going, against, it, is, going, against, the, will, of, the, majority, of, citizens, and, therefore, against, the, very, essence, of, democracy, european, political, parties, should, be, independent, of, national, parties, there, should, be, primaries, open, for, the, citizens, to, choose, the, candidate, it, would, increase, citizen, participation, and, involvement, in, eu, politics, i, do, n't, think, the, eu, needs, the, same, problem, as, france, where, the, elections, are, just, about, which, guy, people, should, select, and, which, candidate, looks, the, best, to, handle, the, position, what, will, the, europeans, think, if, the, candidates, are, always, for, each, election, either, french, german, or, maybe, spanish, and, neither, coming, from, small, countries,  , to, have, a, chance, that, one, candidate, with, a, good, chance, to, win, comes, from, your, own, country, i, think, people, from, little, countries, can, wait, 40, years, this, will, definitely, destroy, the, european, belonging, feeling, you, want, to, promote, with, this, idea, intensive, care, medicine, deserves, to, be, added, to, the, annex, v, as, well, as, all, citizens, of, the, eu, deserve, top, standards, of, critical, care, and, safety, when, admitted, to, this, demanding, environment, the, pandemic, has, put, european, intensive, care, units, icus, under, extreme, pressure, the, most, important, lesson, learned, early, on, in, the, chaos, of, the, pandemic, was, that, equipment, and, medicines, are, necessary, to, save, lives, but, without, adequately, trained, human, resources, these, elements, are, irrelevant, ventilators, do, n’t, operate, themselves,    , we, saw, patients, in, very, critical, condition, being, moved, away, from, their, families, from, one, member, state, to, another, to, receive, treatment, while, allowing, the, doctors, to, move, would, be, much, more, efficient, and, less, life, threatening, for, the, patients, technology, brings, people, together, when, they, are, distant, accelerates, bureaucratic, procedures, it, allows, us, to, work, from, home, or, from, any, country, in, the, eu, or, outside, it, allows, for, an, immense, flow, of, information, to, be, easily, accessible, to, us, as, long, as, people, do, not, want, to, do, illegal, online, activities, it, is, each, person, ’s, individual, decision, what, to, do, with, their, own, online, time, or, how, much, time, they, might, want, to, be, online, the, covid-19,   , pandemic, has, shown, us, why, robust, public, health, and, social, care, systems, are, so, important, for, everyone, for, rich, and, poor, alike, alongside, other, public, services, they, should, be, orientated, towards, the, common, good, and, not, towards, private, gain, this, makes, them, the, backbone, of, fair, and, sustainable, societies, such, a, platform, if, it, provides, youngsters, with, free, or, at, least, affordable, mental, health, assistance, will, help, them, finally, able, to, overcome, our, society, ’s, barriers, to, taking, care, of, our, mental, health, and, emotional, well, being, horrible, idea, next, you, will, limit, water, or, air, this, is, not, the, way, to, move, on, climate, change, you, can, do, much, more, via, mass, politics, and, not, focus, on, individuals, or, limit, their, freedoms, if, you, want, to, stop, eating, meat, do, so, i, wo, n't, the, range, of, primary, care, services, should, be, available, to, all, patients, universally, with, special, emphasis, on, those, at, the, margins, often, in, most, need, i, think, increasing, taxes, on, tobacco, could, do, a, similar, thing,   , but, then, we, would, also, have, to, increase, the, contributions, to, health, insurance, for, people, who, overeat, sugar, use, sunbeds, etc, to, be, fair, this, only, works, if, you, 're, young, and, healthy, otherwise, you, 're, a, bad, risk, for, private, health, insurance, and, it, will, become, even, more, expensive, it, seems, like, a, no, brainer, to, say, something, like, this, but, actually, the, way, we, handle, soil, must, change, massively, to, halt, the, climate, crisis, and, mitigate, its, consequences, thus, we, need, to, recultivate, and, restore, abandoned, and, contaminated, places, and, shift, agriculture, to, regenerative, agriculture, or, restoration, agriculture, we, need, to, stabilize, family, farms, and, make, them, ecologically, financially, and, socially, sustainable, we, need, between, big, and, medium, sized, farms, and, also, highly, productive, smallholder, farms, and, wildlife, reservoirs, this, all, depends, on, a, lot, of, labor, engaged, people, and, legal, and, conceptual, infrastructure, having, all, this, in, place, will, foster, urban, areas, as, well, if, rural, areas, are, to, become, more, attractive, to, live, in, and, work, it, is, essential, to, bet, on, innovation, and, the, creation, of, quality, jobs, unfortunately, in, our, society, a, healthy, person, is, not, profitable, pharma, is, a, big, business, doctors, are, being, paid, for, prescribing, drugs,   , modern, healthcare, should, be, preventive, doctors, should, be, encouraged, and, paid, for, curing, people, and, keeping, them, healthy,   , good, quality, healthcare, should, be, accessible, in, every, part, of, the, world, and, should, be, free, as, there, is, nothing, more, important, than, human, life, it, should, n't, be, the, european, families, who, pay, for, the, damage, caused, by, multinational, corporations, raising, prices, in, the, energy, sector, can, not, be, the, solution, in, the, fight, against, climate, change, the, european, commission, allows, international, firms, to, increase, their, prices, and, as, a, result, household, costs, are, rising, at, an, incredible, rate, the, eu, should, definitely, revoke, these, decisions, and, instead, of, placing, the, burden, on, its, own, citizens, it, should, instead, support, them, to, lead, a, more, sustainable, way, of, life, the, green, transition, should, not, be, a, heavy, burden, borne, on, the, average, citizen, ’s, shoulders, this, is, especially, true, when, we, know, how, much, alcohol, is, damaging, the, brain, in, particular, in, the, developing, brain, of, teenagers, also, unlike, cannabis, over, consumption, of, alcohol, leads, to, death, so, i, would, say, that, this, product, is, much, more, dangerous, yet, unlike, cannabis, alcohol, is, legal, in, france, political, repression, fueled, by, rightwing, ideology, and, ignorance, led, cities, like, marseille, to, develop, rampant, crime, that, fed, on, the, lucrative, market, of, cannabis, worst, this, criminality, is, intertwined, with, radical, islam, in, poor, neighborhoods, the, youth, will, choose, the, easy, money, and, start, dealing, tax, revenues, generated, by, cannabis, could, be, redirected, towards, education, in, poor, neighborhoods, increasing, teachers, pay, in, these, areas, reducing, the, number, of, teachers, per, class, in, order, to, give, these, populations, a, better, future, but, unlike, in, the, netherlands, production, should, also, be, legal, and, highly, regulated, by, the, state, i, think, a, very, good, transportation, system, within, european, cities, is, very, much, desirable, there, is, not, enough, space, for, many, parking, lots, anyway, electro, cars, wo, n't, be, able, to, replace, common, cars, and, urban, spaces, have, to, become, greener,   , in, order, for, many, people, to, accept, that, the, use, of, cars, will, have, been, a, thing, of, the, past, they, should, be, offered, very, good, alternatives, in, the, future, and, hopefully, appreciate, green, mobility, through, good, public, transport, within, urban, areas, the, incentive, to, provide, free, public, transport, in, european, cities, in, the, future, would, make, it, easier, for, people, especially, in, the, cities, to, accept, and, appreciate, that, there, will, be, fewer, and, fewer, cars, people, who, benefit, from, current, examples, are, happy, about, it, a, common, digital, platform, where, data, will, be, recorded, in, an, anonymized, way, could, also, be, very, helpful, for, the, future, not, only, in, case, of, new, pandemic, situations, however, as, data, itself, has, a, market, value, and, as, we, have, learned, about, the, global, interdependency, in, an, emergency, situation, e.g., with, vaccines, no, company, should, capitalize, on, this, data,   , the, data, should, be, accessible, for, public, research, and, used, for, monitoring, public, health, e.g., by, european, institutions, it, would, help, to, further, unite, the, nations, during, the, pandemic, the, eu, was, unable, to, produce, a, vaccine, on, its, own, mainly, due, to, the, fact, that, not, enough, money, is, invested, in, research, within, its, different, member, states, gathering, the, strength, of, the, 27, member, states, in, research, and, health, could, be, a, real, asset, for, the, eu, and, its, citizens, but, also, for, its, influence, overseas, and, its, independence, i, believe, that, the, problem, is, not, what, we, eat, but, rather, how, food, is, produced,    , when, we, talk, about, meat, we, should, make, a, distinction, between, industrial, production, which, is, damaging, our, environment, and, family, run, businesses, once, which, is, not, instead, of, prohibiting, food, something, that, is, practically, speaking, impossible, to, do, we, should, rather, enhance, local, food, solutions, and, increase, people, 's, awareness, regarding, the, impact, of, their, buying, choices, our, goal, should, be, making, local, products, and, green, goods, available, to, everyone, and, not, a, privilege, of, people, who, are, wealthy, enough, to, be, able, to, afford, them, no, this, is, a, horrible, idea, to, force, people, to, go, vegan, while, i, agree, that, we, as, a, society, are, eating, too, much, meat, which, is, bad, for, both, the, environment, and, our, health, this, will, only, create, tension, and, anger, towards, the, eu, i, have, no, illusions, that, rich, and, influential, people, will, find, a, way, to, get, as, much, meat, as, they, want, and, then, distribute, it, on, the, black, market, public, services, of, good, quality, and, universal, access, are, key, to, ensuring, fairer, more, inclusive, and, equal, societies, they, have, a, clear, redistributive, effect, and, help, steer, development, in, a, more, sustainable, direction, the, covid-19, crisis, if, anything, helped, to, prove, the, crucial, role, that, the, public, sector, and, public, services, play, and, must, continue, playing, traditional, complementary, and, integrative, medicine, is, a, safe, and, efficient, way, to, improve, well, being, and, happiness, and, prevent, illness, also, an, innumerable, amount, of, people, have, got, significant, palliation, or, even, total, cure, in, cases, which, the, official, health, care, system, unfortunately, could, n't, help, this, is, clearly, an, area, where, countries, civilizations, and, schools, of, thought, could, learn, a, lot, from, each, other, the, government, does, not, have, any, right, to, use, the, taxpayer, 's, money, to, propagandize, the, people, to, encourage, what, to, eat, and, not, to, eat, it, is, not, the, responsibility, of, the, government, today, cannabis, repression, is, simply, a, political, posture, aimed, to, target, rightwing, voters, not, a, rational, policy, i, think, the, problem, in, the, eu, is, the, incompetence, to, establish, inventions, in, the, market, there, are, lots, of, inventions, that, are, made, and, funded, by, public, eu, research, facilities, brought, into, the, market, by, small, startups, in, the, end, they, are, picked, like, ripe, fruits, by, the, us, or, chinese, companies, where, the, big, money, is, made, i, think, forcing, people, to, eat, a, limited, amount, of, meat, is, totally, the, wrong, way, because, of, the, following, reasons,   , 1, it, would, cause, so, much, more, bureaucracy,   , 2, forbidding, it, would, understandably, make, a, lot, of, people, very, mad, i, mean, who, likes, to, be, told, what, to, eat,   , 3, i, think, it, 's, important, to, have, the, freedom, to, eat, what, you, want, i, think, a, much, better, solution, would, be, to, increase, the, tax, on, meat, making, it, less, attractive, for, people, that, 's, a, terrible, idea, the, government, propaganda, machine, is, already, going, at, full, steam, do, you, have, any, idea, what, the, psychological, impact, of, these, kinds, of, messages, is, when, you, blast, them, at, people, all, day, every, day, for, over, a, year,   , depression, suicides, and, domestic, violence, are, all, the, consequences, of, living, in, a, hopeless, and, high, stress, environment, for, a, protracted, period, of, time, and, are, at, record, levels, throughout, europe, in, this, entire, covid, crisis, the, so, called, health, experts, have, consequently, ignored, the, fact, that, your, mental, state, has, a, direct, influence, on, your, health, i.e., if, you, 're, stressed, out, you, 're, more, likely, to, get, sick, instead, they, have, willfully, created, panic, just, like, your, ad, would, i, think, the, eu, should, subsidies, troubled, cash, strapped, cities, to, reduce, ticket, prices, or, completely, remove, any, charges, so, that, people, are, vivisected, to, hop, on, the, bus, rather, than, in, the, car, as, i, student, i, would, have, been, in, the, city, center, a, lot, more, and, spent, money, around, the, shops, if, i, could, afford, the, bus, fair, in, the, first, place, nothing, illustrates, to, me, more, the, fall, of, european, ethics, than, pro, abortion, arguments, nobody, can, dispute, that, a, baby, in, the, womb, is, alive, and, human, and, yet, people, call, their, killing, a, human, right, how, could, we, fall, so, low, juridical, protection, of, dignity, right, to, life, and, integrity, of, every, human, being, from, conception, are, of, fundamental, importance, for, the, future, of, europe,   , the, dignity, and, integrity, of, the, human, embryo, must, be, respected, this, is, enounced, by, the, ecj, in, the, brüstle, vs, greenpeace, case, which, recalls, the, definition, of, the, human, embryo, as, the, beginning, of, the, development, of, the, human, being, to, ensure, consistency, in, areas, of, its, competence, where, the, life, of, the, human, embryo, is, at, stake, the, eu, should, prohibit, that, presuppose, the, destruction, of, human, embryos, it, is, absolutely, necessary, that, we, have, a, system, of, accountability, both, for, member, states, and, other, countries, human, rights, and, liberties, always, come, first, hungary, ’s, and, poland, ’s, governments, have, ruthlessly, corrupted, their, judgments, to, get, a, free, card, on, abstract, eu, funds, enough, if, even, romania, can, be, carried, out, to, join, the, enhanced, cooperation, those, last, two, must, be, forced, the, eu, must, take, a, strong, position, against, corruption, and, be, in, favor, of, an, independent, supranational, proscecutor, that, is, the, eppo, the, european, union, is, not, a, country, and, we, must, respect, other, countries, electoral, choices, i, have, advice, on, how, you, can, defend, against, anything, on, the, internet, turn, it, off, and, one, more, piece, of, advice, try, to, study, something, about, freedom, and, responsibility, they, are, not, just, mere, words, plato, socrates, hayek, borovský, auberon, herbert, herbert, spencer, roger, scruton, ronald, reagan, speeches, ben, shapiro, jordan, peterson, there, are, texts, thousands, of, years, old, and, also, recent, books, you, can, start, anywhere, you, wish, mostly, agree, only, if, a, country, violates, basic, human, rights, its, vote, in, the, eu, should, be, suspended, and/or, financial, sanctions, imposed, tailored, to, target, the, offending, government, and, its, supporters, but, such, a, country, should, not, be, excluded, from, the, eu, because, that, would, mostly, harm, the, opposition, which, is, likely, to, be, more, eu, friendly, will, russia, also, pay, their, share, will, austria, pay, for, starting, ww1, or, will, it, be, serbia, will, poland, and, hungary, pay, for, occupation, of, parts, of, czechoslovakia, in, 1938/1939, will, france, pay, for, starting, napoleonic, wars, it, is, time, to, forget, what, happened, almost, 100, years, ago, and, focus, on, the, future, and, i, say, that, as, a, czech, citizen, whose, country, was, occupied, by, austria, germany, poland, hungary, and, then, by, sssr, and, all, eastern, satelite, states, according, to, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, rights, of, people, with, disabilities, the, european, union, shall, closely, consult, with, and, actively, involve, persons, with, disabilities, on, political, decisions, that, concern, them, meanwhile, the, european, strategy, for, the, rights, of, persons, with, disabilities, 2021, 2030, hardly, mentioned, people, with, intellectual, and, neurological, disabilities,   , now, the, conference, for, the, future, of, europe, wants, to, be, an, inclusive, citizen, consultation, but, is, still, not, making, it, a, priority, to, include, citizens, with, trisomy, 21, autism, or, members, of, other, neurodivergent, communities, ableism, keeps, getting, perpetuated, in, the, eu, and, it, needs, to, stop,   , we, want, more, representation, we, want, people, with, down, syndrome, to, be, fully, included, in, the, european, union, institutions, absolutely, unacceptable, because, it, would, lead, to, the, politicization, of, the, justice, system, several, member, states, have, been, turned, into, dictatorships, a, year, ago, and, there, is, no, sign, of, a, return, to, democracy, freezing, temporarily, their, eu, membership, status, is, to, be, considered, to, those, where, there, is, no, more, freedom, in, crossing, borders, be, even, inside, borders, de, fr, no, more, press, freedom, most, no, more, debate, most, no, more, press, or, individual, liberty, to, have, any, credibility, when, addressing, foreign, countries, regarding, issues, of, human, rights, violations, curbs, on, the, freedom, of, speech, and, press, democracy, and, more, the, eu, must, ensure, that, its, member, states, meet, minimum, standards, on, these, fronts, too, current, concerns, about, rule, of, law, infringements, are, simply, being, brushed, off, as, national, matters, if, this, continues, how, can, the, eu, assume, authority, to, promote, democracy, abroad, more, strict, and, enforceable, minimum, standards, must, be, introduced, under, clearly, increasing, penalties, for, non, compliance, if, shared, values, and, democracy, are, indeed, a, requisite, to, be, a, part, of, the, eu, then, continued, adherence, should, be, a, precondition, to, remain, a, part, of, it, i, totally, agree, maybe, would, be, glad, if, a, press, company, could, be, sanctioned, for, misleading, information, or, even, if, it, repeats, they, could, have, their, press, licenses, voided, it, is, crazy, how, much, misleading, information, is, out, there, many, people, are, sharing, it, and, nobody, is, taking, responsibility, for, it, in, addition, there, could, be, a, discussion, in, which, only, verified, users, real, people, could, have, access, to, the, press, 's, online, chat, discussion, under, the, reported, topic, we, are, increasingly, witnessing, malicious, journalism, corrupted, by, feelings, and, disinformation, the, purpose, of, the, press, services, must, as, soon, as, possible, be, to, bring, the, news, back, to, the, public, in, the, most, detailed, and, detailed, manner, possible, without, inciting, malicious, and, incorrect, drawing, of, attention, in, fact, political, ngos, advocating, for, any, cause, whatsoever, should, be, banned, from, schools, and, kindergartens, as, europe, bears, the, burden, of, the, xxth, century, authoritarian, regimes, right, and, left, and, saw, their, children, ideologically, possessed, by, fascist, and, communist, governmental, propaganda, hitlerjugend, right, and, pioneer, left, movements, we, need, to, limit, the, access, of, the, children, as, one, of, the, most, vulnerable, groups, of, our, community, to, every, political, ideology, and, propagating, associations, the, administration, of, justice, is, a, member, state, competence, shadowy, attempts, by, federalist, institutions, to, enhance, their, influence, at, the, expense, of, the, sovereign, member, states, are, contrary, to, the, letter, of, the, eu, treaties, counter, productive, and, have, contributed, greatly, to, the, crisis, of, the, eu, by, alienating, national, institutions, this, is, especially, the, case, for, courts, several, member, states, high, courts, have, declared, the, ecj, ultra, vires, acting, beyond, its, powers, this, lawlessness, on, the, part, of, federalist, institutions, must, stop, with, immediate, effect, and, we, must, reaffirm, the, principles, of, subsidiarity, and, conferral, it, is, unacceptable, every, nation, has, the, right, to, organize, its, own, prosecution, system, and, no, foreign, prosecutor, should, be, allowed, to, operate, in, independent, states, it, is, a, threat, to, the, sovereignty, of, the, member, states, the, eu, deciding, who, is, a, journalist, amounts, to, the, eu, deciding, what, is, true, legal, traditions, are, different, for, a, reason, they, are, the, result, of, centuries, of, organic, legal, evolution, they, can, not, be, overwritten, with, a, stroke, of, a, pen, abortion, kills, a, human, being, it, can, be, justified, only, in, very, rare, cases, every, human, being, has, a, conscience, that, allows, them, to, recognize, what, is, true, and, what, is, good, and, it, is, by, virtue, of, this, awareness, that, we, demand, that, no, european, union, funds, be, allocated, to, activities, that, destroy, human, embryos, stop, woke, ideology, introducing, orwellian, newspeak, aborting, children, with, down, is, not, love, is, not, an, inclusive, society, it, is, discrimination, against, the, most, vulnerable, the, eu, has, no, business, promoting, democracy, anywhere, beyond, its, borders, have, we, not, seen, sufficiently, clearly, in, the, past, two, decades, where, democracy, export, leads, freedom, bombs, and, human, suffering, everywhere,   , no, the, eu, must, fully, respect, the, sovereignty, and, national, characters, of, all, nations, of, this, world, and, that, includes, its, own, member, states, the, eu, must, immediately, return, to, the, letter, of, the, eu, treaties, and, reaffirm, in, the, strongest, term, the, principles, of, conferral, and, subsidiarity, we, are, all, here, to, fight, the, prohibition, of, eugenic, practices, such, as, abortion, which, organize, and, consequently, encourage, the, preventive, elimination, of, individuals, who, do, not, comply, with, the, social, medical, and, family, criteria, set, by, the, ideal, of, man, what, a, perfect, 21st, century, the, eu, should, do, it, in, an, impartial, manner, and, act, against, all, countries, regardless, of, political, ideology, the, eu, should, stand, out, to, help, all, minorities, and, not, just, the, politically, advantageous, ones, the, oppression, of, catalonians, and, hungarian, minorities, outside, its, border, is, a, constant, problem, since, ww2, and, it, is, completely, ignored, if, the, eu, wants, to, convince, the, masses, then, it, ca, n't, just, cherrypick, issues, from, the, association, christian, in, democracy, spain, we, are, clear, that, life, is, the, greatest, good, of, a, society, and, as, such, must, be, protected, from, its, conception, to, its, natural, end, for, this, reason, it, should, be, part, of, the, european, union, 's, charter, of, fundamental, rights, and, be, protected, from, attacks, against, defenseless, human, beings, such, as, in, the, cases, of, abortion, and, euthanasia, this, is, an, attempt, to, combine, the, multi, speed, europe, concept, with, the, idea, that, european, principles, and, values, can, be, used, as, ideological, clubs, to, beat, those, who, engage, in, wrongthinking, over, the, head, with, if, you, insist, on, a, set, of, shared, eu, principles, and, values, that, go, beyond, a, mere, symbolic, declaration, these, principles, and, values, must, include, our, real, heritage, the, judeo, christian, values, that, have, made, europe, great, traditional, family, values, are, first, and, foremost, all, these, values, must, be, clearly, defined, in, a, legal, sense, people, with, trisomy, 21, in, europe, have, much, higher, rates, of, unemployment, social, exclusion, poverty, and, discrimination, the, european, union, must, make, it, a, priority, to, change, this, situation, it, seems, that, the, eu, is, much, more, concerned, with, the, rights, of, sexual, minorities, than, with, ethnic, minorities, this, is, a, universal, problem, for, all, ethnic, minorities, in, the, eu,   , outside, the, eu, there, are, even, more, severe, problems, ukraine, for, instance, forces, kids, to, study, in, ukrainian, refusing, them, and, their, parents, the, right, to, receive, an, education, in, the, language, they, choose, seems, utterly, barbaric, in, the, 21st, century, but, the, eu, does, nothing, about, this, despite, the, influence, it, holds, over, kyiv, unfortunately, the, values, and, rights, are, interpreted, and, exercised, differently, in, the, states, of, the, european, union, whether, we, are, speaking, about, minority, protection, language, rights, or, cultural, values, we, can, see, every, day, that, the, eu, is, constantly, retaliating, against, the, hungarians, in, transylvania, when, despite, the, legislation, in, force, it, ignores, the, lawlessness, and, atrocities, committed, against, the, hungarians, as, a, native, minority, furthermore, the, european, union, should, give, priority, to, all, situations, in, which, hungarians, in, transylvania, are, victims, of, discrimination, europe, must, lead, the, way, when, it, comes, to, integrating, people, with, down, syndrome, judeo, christian, values, are, the, cornerstone, of, european, civilization, they, deserve, special, protection, because, they, made, us, who, we, are, today,   , mass, migration, from, people, with, cultures, totally, alien, to, europe, is, the, phenomenon, that, most, threatens, eu, security, and, cohesion, everyone, 's, human, rights, must, be, respected, but, illegal, migrants, are, criminals, and, should, be, treated, as, such, not, pampered, mass, migration, must, end, we, most, definitely, do, not, need, a, wider, definition, of, gender, based, anything, gender, is, a, politicized, left, wing, concept, i, certainly, encourage, wider, protection, from, violence, against, women, and, girls, that, should, most, definitely, include, protection, from, the, violence, and, coercion, young, women, face, from, trans, activists, we, also, want, nothing, to, do, with, intersectionality, which, is, a, neo, marxist, concept, of, overlapping, oppressions, no, one, is, being, oppressed, in, europe, we, pay, taxes, and, we, have, the, right, to, see, where, our, money, goes, it, ’s, very, easy, to, implement, through, an, online, platform, same, as, digital, banking, but, for, the, state, this, will, stamp, out, corruption, and, thereby, free, up, a, huge, amount, of, money, that, we, can, spend, on, the, needs, of, the, population, the, defense, of, the, equality, of, value, and, dignity, of, each, and, every, single, human, life, is, decisive, for, the, future, of, europe, ensure, equal, opportunities, for, girls, and, women, provide, them, sufficient, maternity, leave, and, institute, guarantees, that, will, protect, women, 's, careers, who, choose, to, have, children, those, are, the, steps, we, need, and, most, eu, countries, already, have, them, not, that, they, can, not, be, improved, there, 's, absolutely, no, need, for, quotas, we, are, all, for, equal, rights, and, opportunities, for, women, however, modern, feminism, has, gone, so, far, beyond, the, pale, that, it, can, no, longer, be, supported,   , the, bbc, has, recently, found, out, that, some, lesbians, are, increasingly, being, pressured, and, coerced, into, accepting, trans, women, as, sexual, partners, in, effect, fourth, wave, feminism, has, reached, the, point, where, males, are, once, again, telling, females, who, to, have, sex, with, this, must, stop, yes, the, european, union, needs, effective, policies, to, combat, online, hate, speech, and, these, need, to, be, regularly, updated, as, technology, evolves, and, to, take, into, account, worldwide, learning, on, how, to, effectively, combat, online, hate, speech, the, internet, has, provided, unprecedented, opportunities, to, express, and, comment, on, almost, anything, but, this, also, brings, with, it, responsibility, where, is, the, boundary, between, freedom, of, expression, and, speech, hate, speech, which, is, no, longer, tolerated, by, the, law, how, can, we, oppose, such, acts, such, as, insults, vulgarism, or, threats, on, social, networks, or, can, everyone, say, anything, on, the, internet, aggression, division, and, violence, we, see, in, mass, media, should, be, stopped, only, the, best, human, qualities, should, be, promoted, this, way, we, will, raise, a, generation, of, kind, caring, and, responsible, people, this, will, create, conditions, for, the, development, and, education, of, a, human, with, a, capital, h, cultivating, moral, values, in, each, person, and, society,   , we, should, prohibit, propaganda, of, violence, condemnation, and, denunciation, of, any, form, of, division, aggression, and, anti, humane, manifestations, people, 's, feelings, are, nt, all, that, important, if, you, have, had, enough, of, the, internet, you, can, always, find, yourself, a, hobby, all, wrong, let, everyone, decide, for, himself, or, herself, forcing, women, into, specific, positions, is, bad, and, sexist, i, guess, quotas, are, always, disgusting, examples, of, oppression, and, evil, i, do, n't, want, anything, of, that, i, want, freedom, and, free, choice, if, you, want, something, like, increasing, the, percentage, of, women, in, all, sectors, you, need, to, create, more, women, or, reduce, the, number, of, men, i, will, better, not, ask, questions, in, this, direction, every, harpy, screams, more, black, women, in, power, until, candace, owens, appears, clever, charming, black, woman, but, she, is, too, clever, pro, freedom, and, conservative, and, that, is, the, problem, so, it, is, n't, about, women, it, 's, mere, greed, and, desire, for, power, and, influence, every, human, has, the, right, to, live, the, developing, child, in, the, womb, the, children, the, adults, and, those, who, are, of, old, age, and, need, nursing, the, united, states, is, investing, an, average, of, more, or, less, 25, million, euros, per, year, on, health, care, research, for, people, with, trisomy, 21, while, the, european, union, is, lagging, far, behind, with, only, 3, million, per, year, this, huge, difference, is, proof, of, the, lack, of, political, commitment, in, the, european, union, and, shows, how, little, the, eu, prioritizes, health, care, and, future, health, care, for, people, with, trisomy, 21, the, situation, of, young, people, is, difficult, temporary, jobs, precarious, contracts, civic, contracts, replacing, regular, employment, forced, self, employment, lack, of, basic, social, protection, and, even, age, discriminatory, practices, also, on, the, basis, of, age, are, still, the, norm, for, millions, of, young, people, who, are, trying, to, make, their, way, in, the, labor, market, they, need, urgent, help, esperanto, is, politically, neutral, it, is, not, used, by, any, european, nation, although, there, is, some, culture, connected, to, the, language, there, is, no, political, or, economic, power, imposing, it, also, where, english, is, connected, to, the, us, canada, australia, and, other, countries, esperanto, would, be, a, truly, european, language, to, build, a, common, european, understanding, and, to, create, a, european, identity, we, need, our, own, common, language, esperanto, is, linguistically, neutral, the, language, was, created, with, the, principle, of, internationality, in, a, european, context, it, ’s, democratic, there, are, no, native, speakers, of, esperanto, or, better, yet, not, any, monolingual, speakers, of, esperanto, everyone, has, to, learn, it, as, a, second, language, as, a, result, of, this, nobody, will, have, an, advantage, over, others, and, nobody, can, feel, like, a, stranger, since, nobody, can, feel, like, a, native, everyone, is, respected, regardless, of, their, origin, and, not, discouraged, from, learning, the, language, i, agree, young, people, should, have, a, voice, in, policymaking, regulation, needs, to, reduce, forms, of, precarious, work,   , it, is, time, to, expand, collective, bargaining, coverage, to, all, forms, of, work, it, is, essential, to, introduce, a, right, to, decent, housing, and, policies, capping, rents, and, limiting, property, market, speculation, we, urgently, need, investment, to, achieve, this, youth, is, the, future, we, have, to, take, care, of, it, a, lot, of, programs, nowadays, sound, really, good, on, paper, but, there, always, is, someone, bending, the, rules, there, needs, to, be, outside, monitoring, in, every, youth, program, of, that, sort, we, see, this, problem, in, many, countries, and, the, situation, is, getting, worse, the, pandemic, also, took, its, toll, stable, quality, jobs, and, adequate, social, protection, are, necessary, if, we, do, n't, want, to, see, a, great, strain, on, social, systems, in, the, long, term, to, prevent, precarious, conditions, we, must, put, in, place, quality, standards, they, must, be, binding, for, all, jobs, created, under, eu, and, national, recovery, plans, better, monitoring, and, trade, union, involvement, are, needed, to, assess, and, report, youth, unemployment, and, neet, rates, at, the, moment, these, numbers, hide, forced, mobility, involuntary, part, time, employment, and, work, in, a, grey, and, informal, economy, urgent, measures, are, needed, to, fight, youth, unemployment, and, precarious, working, conditions, in, sectors, where, young, people, are, overrepresented, tourism, gig, economy, i, agree, stable, quality, jobs, and, adequate, social, protection, for, everyone, are, necessary,   , trade, unions, have, many, proposals, to, achieve, more, equal, and, inclusive, labor, markets,   , this, goes, hand, in, hand, with, policies, to, promote, more, equal, sustainable, and, inclusive, societies,  , we, can, not, afford, a, lost, generation, so, we, need, to, invest, in, quality, jobs, and, young, people, for, our, future, the, problem, of, youth, employment, has, been, there, for, a, long, time, but, was, underlined, again, during, the, pandemic, many, young, people, are, forced, to, move, to, a, different, country, in, order, to, find, work, young, people, are, too, often, working, under, precarious, conditions, think, of, short, term, zero, hour, contracts, and, unpaid, internships, many, of, them, can, only, get, a, job, if, they, are, registered, as, self, employed, carrying, all, the, responsibilities, themselves, and, still, being, underpaid, everyone, should, be, able, to, get, a, decent, job, and, access, social, protection, trade, unions, play, a, crucial, role, in, addressing, these, issues, and, defending, this, vulnerable, group, which, is, why, it, is, important, that, young, workers, join, a, trade, union, all, workers, and, unemployed, should, have, access, to, social, protection, including, young, people, it, is, embedded, in, the, core, principle, of, the, european, pillar, of, social, rights, but, those, high, and, lofty, principles, must, become, a, reality, for, all, workers, old, and, young, integration, and, immigration, in, a, host, country, require, a, lot, of, effort, this, will, relieve, the, european, prison, system, this, would, encourage, many, migrants, to, take, responsibility, for, the, laws, of, the, host, countries, building, walls, is, a, sign, of, fear, and, weakness, a, common, policy, is, a, completely, wrong, solution, it, will, only, lead, to, the, fact, that, the, system, will, be, fully, implemented, on, the, terms, of, sweden, and, germany, who, support, open, borders, and, will, bring, down, the, entire, eu, and, the, traditional, welfare, states, fear, of, the, unknown, is, normal, behavior, it, has, saved, our, race, since, ages, starting, when, mankind, was, a, simple, monkey, among, others, additionally, when, fear, is, reinforced, by, facts, like, increased, violence, in, every, country, with, a, high, number, of, immigrants, and, rapes, of, women, it, is, not, a, problem, of, perception, but, a, simple, reality, halt, all, immigration, from, non, european, or, non, first, world, countries, into, the, eu, the, dividing, of, refugees, is, a, long, discussed, plan, but, in, the, end, no, involved, group, agreed, with, these, plans, some, countries, do, not, like, these, people, at, all, the, eu, should, support, democracies, rather, than, dictatorships, and, value, the, support, of, democracy, over, economic, gains, china, is, acting, against, european, values, and, violating, intellectual, property, rights, no, more, non, european, immigration, the, native, europeans, have, said, no, too, many, times, so, called, leaders, around, the, world, like, trump, and, boris, johnson, have, made, a, mockery, of, europe, and, europeans, with, zero, response, from, eu, leaders, these, things, affect, people, 's, pride, and, give, out, a, sense, of, weakness, maybe, while, helping, economic, integration, in, africa, to, happen, we, will, discover, that, we, could, go, further, in, our, own, eu, development, we, could, foster, transnational, companies, which, operate, on, both, continents, but, not, primarily, the, very, big, ones, i, think, of, companies, that, supply, solar, power, solutions, to, rural, areas, or, microcredit, banks, create, platforms, where, best, choice, and, best, practice, solutions, can, evolve, this, way, we, can, establish, a, single, common, market, european, citizens, are, the, future, of, europe, the, proposal, of, the, sardines, to, reform, eu, asylum, policy, is, an, excellent, proposal, well, and, thoroughly, written, just, arguing, to, keep, migrants, out, is, very, shortsighted, and, unhistorical, by, keeping, migrants, out, migration, pressure, will, not, abate, so, what, do, you, suggest, for, next, year, 10, years, from, now,  , migration, has, been, a, fact, of, history, and, successful, societies, have, found, ways, to, turn, migration, into, strength, in, our, case, in, order, to, alleviate, the, current, challenge, in, the, long, term, we, need, to, alleviate, migration, pressure, by, making, it, attractive, for, migrants, to, stay, put, and, help, develop, their, own, countries, such, a, helpful, project, a, european, marshal, plan, for, africa, would, be, a, good, project, to, invest, in, the, long, term, return, on, investment, would, be, more, than, financial, a, friendly, neighbor, continent, good, relationships, access, to, the, african, market, and, natural, resources, that, is, not, a, short, term, fix, and, there, is, no, short, term, fix, we, have, to, play, the, long, game, why, ca, n't, arab, countries, shelter, refugees, from, other, arab, countries, same, habits, religion, and, they, have, enough, wealth, it, 's, arrogant, to, tell, us, we, should, look, for, another, name, germans, and, italians, are, europeans, just, like, serbians, or, macedonians, in, the, other, words, brits, can, call, themselves, europeans, and, so, can, we, therefore, eu, citizens, are, european, his, is, the, issue, in, politics, and, public, sector, policy, making, no, objectives, are, to, be, pursued, no, problems, to, be, solved, i, guess, it, is, the, nature, of, the, beast, balancing, conflicting, interests, the, eu, is, established, on, treaties, but, treaties, have, no, soul, only, a, constitution, has, a, soul, provided, it, is, well, designed, from, by, and, for, the, people, the, demographic, problems, for, the, eu, which, are, real, must, be, solved, by, encouraging, child, bearing, and, a, generous, family, policy, not, through, migration, we, must, celebrate, motherhood, and, moms, we, must, realize, that, raising, a, child, involves, serious, costs, in, today, 's, europe, a, humanitarian, association, that, helps, a, migrant, to, enter, the, eu, illegally, should, lose, its, government, eu, funding, with, highly, subsidized, agricultural, products, the, eu, destroys, local, markets, in, african, countries, this, procedure, should, be, stopped, as, soon, as, possible, eu, agricultural, subsidies, should, be, replaced, with, incentives, and, support, for, a, sustainable, transition, the, earlier, we, abandon, these, unfair, and, highly, unsustainable, subsidies, the, better, for, our, own, future, health, social, development, and, climate, future, also, this, will, lead, to, a, better, relationship, with, african, union, and, enable, better, livelihoods, for, african, farmers, and, citizens,  , we, have, already, done, great, damage, to, eu, credibility, by, pointless, posturing, we, should, halt, all, immigration, from, non, european, or, non, first, world, countries, into, the, eu, however, if, we, want, to, stop, this, immigration, we, must, stop, its, causes, indeed, it, is, war, poverty, and, european, chinese, and, american, neo, colonialism, that, make, the, people, of, african, and, middle, eastern, countries, flee, to, europe, so, europe, must, finally, take, responsibility, and, protect, these, countries, from, corruption, war, and, neo, colonialism, and, help, them, to, start, their, economy, for, europe, to, act, outwardly, as, a, unit, we, must, first, look, inward, at, the, psychological, level, how, can, we, create, a, european, home, market, what, does, it, take, for, example, for, a, resident, of, spain, to, think, of, czech, printers, as, a, local, product, will, it, be, possible, to, reach, an, agreement, on, europe, 's, historical, events, and, interpret, them, to, everyone, 's, satisfaction, this, process, will, take, some, time, migration, from, countries, with, incompatible, cultural, values, and, ideologies, should, be, limited, or, stopped, to, ensure, social, cohesion, in, europe, regressive, outdated, ideologies, and, values, should, have, no, place, in, europe, the, migrants, that, are, already, legally, here, should, be, taught, western, values, so, they, and, their, families, can, integrate, assimilate, as, the, age, old, saying, goes, when, in, rome, do, as, the, romans, do, what, we, are, now, seeing, are, the, first, waves, of, a, human, tsunami, in, sub, saharan, africa, over, years, the, population, will, have, grown, to, 2,0, billion,   , that, is, more, than, the, people, who, live, in, the, eu, and, us, today,   , at, the, same, time, the, population, in, the, eu, is, shrinking, when, we, keep, the, border, open, the, eu, as, a, viable, society, will, disappear,   , not, much, of, a, future, for, the, young, europeans, the, key, to, successful, immigration, depends, upon, the, possibility, of, employment,   , so, eu, members, are, to, decide, whom, they, want, to, admit,  , illegal, immigrants, have, to, be, returned, to, un, refugee, camps,   , entering, the, eu, without, a, permit, automatically, excludes, a, person, from, any, right, to, receive, asylum, we, must, stop, all, loopholes, for, example, automatically, rejecting, asylum, claims, of, anyone, who, enters, europe, illegally, this, is, just, evidence, immigration, will, be, one, of, the, most, difficult, topics, in, the, next, decades, or, even, years, due, to, the, insane, demographic, rates, the, world, is, suffering, nowadays, so, immigration, has, to, be, closely, monitored, and, all, illegal, immigration, has, to, be, blocked, there, need, to, be, some, rules, for, integration, integration, does, not, mean, giving, up, european, values, and, culture, there, need, to, be, some, rules, for, integration, integration, does, not, mean, completely, open, borders, europe, as, a, whole, is, the, world, ’s, leading, donor, the, european, union, should, strengthen, the, development, cooperation, action, focusing, on, inclusive, development, in, conclusion, we, should, say, europeans, go, home, go, home, leave, every, part, of, the, world, where, we, are, making, business, exploiting, cheap, labor, rare, minerals, selling, arms, invading, foreign, countries, and, exporting, democracy, etc, multiculturalism, creates, chaos, wherever, it, exists, sweden, 's, stockholm, has, become, the, rape, capital, of, the, west, and, the, number, of, bombs, and, shootings, has, skyrocketed, as, well, in, that, country, france, is, bordering, on, civil, war, whole, territories, are, not, under, state, control, anymore, europe, needs, to, stop, migration, and, asylum, indefinitely, we, need, to, put, our, european, peoples, first, much, like, the, entire, world, is, doing, while, our, civilization, is, committing, suicide, based, on, values, imposed, by, sanctimonious, narcissists, there, 's, nothing, wrong, with, not, wanting, your, continent, to, become, chaos, and, putting, your, people, first, every, civilization, in, this, world, takes, that, idea, as, self, evident, we, need, to, negotiate, remigration, deals, with, the, 3rd, countries, to, send, their, nationals, back, and, we, need, to, use, frontex, to, push, back, any, migrants, coming, to, our, borders, the, eu, leadership, fails, to, carry, out, its, fundamental, duties, guard, its, border, and, protect, its, own, people, even, 30, years, after, schengen, was, introduced, immigration, should, not, be, part, of, humanitarian, aid, humanitarian, aid, should, be, delivered, directly, to, africa, asia, the, turkey, deal, should, eventually, be, abolished, europe, must, stay, europe, and, people, must, not, be, imposed, a, cultural, and, religious, change, they, do, not, want, and, which, is, insane, look, at, what, the, arabic, or, north, african, countries, have, become, after, 1400, years, of, islam, a, humanitarian, association, that, helps, a, migrant, to, enter, the, eu, illegally, should, be, required, to, provide, financial, support, in, dignified, conditions, a, humanitarian, association, that, helps, a, migrant, to, enter, the, eu, illegally, should, also, be, dragged, in, front, of, the, court, for, not, taking, the, illegals, to, the, closest, safe, port, in, 90, of, the, cases, the, closest, port, lies, in, africa, we, need, to, stop, all, funding, to, ngos, and, all, migration, organizations, within, the, eu, then, can, we, talk, about, how, to, help, the, people, already, here, and, how, to, help, real, people, in, need, we, need, to, agree, that, people, who, do, not, respect, our, immigration, law, are, detained, in, centers, for, repatriation, the, country, of, origin, should, absolutely, be, the, most, important, criterion, for, deciding, who, we, let, into, our, countries, 160, frenchman, would, still, be, alive, if, we, put, the, welfare, of, our, own, above, people, whose, countries, the, americans, have, bombed, to, shreds,   , it, is, time, to, be, honest, about, this, europeans, have, the, right, to, self, determination, like, every, other, country, out, there, this, is, our, home, and, a, home, for, everyone, is, a, home, for, no, one, our, europe, continent, is, in, debt, and, does, n't, have, the, resources, to, care, for, people, who, have, never, paid, taxes, and, continue, to, disregard, our, laws, we, have, enough, poor, people, in, europe, already, and, we, need, to, take, care, of, them, the, eu, is, an, association, an, international, organization, and, has, nothing, to, do, with, europe, as, a, territory, european, people, may, live, inside, or, outside, the, eu, i, think, has, nothing, to, do, with, arrogance, the, eu, needs, to, establish, a, legal, means, of, preventing, illegal, migration, that, is, encouraged, by, the, turkish, government, and, by, privately, funded, ngos, which, are, acting, against, the, interest, of, the, eu, people, are, willing, to, volunteer, change, in, relation, to, involuntary, inflicted, changes, such, as, technology, economy, and, climate, with, this, in, mind, i, hope, a, european, constitution, will, be, long, lasting, and, help, the, people, we, have, to, react, to, the, circumstances, and, start, fast,  , eu, should, show, more, strength, when, dealing, with, foreign, powers, in, addition, there, should, be, a, vision, about, where, we, want, to, go, in, the, long, term, with, the, eu, and, this, is, in, an, increasingly, complex, and, sometimes, hostile, world, europe, is, full, and, can, not, accept, more, illegal, migrants, those, persons, must, be, sent, back, and, have, to, ask, for, approval, from, their, state, of, origin, for, a, better, migration, policy, a, european, mission, could, be, created, to, welcome, migrants, from, the, coasts, of, libya, and, tunisia, people, welcomed, in, the, centers, in, north, africa, will, be, re, distributed, to, the, countries, of, the, union, are, you, insane, ukraine, is, infamous, for, its, black, market, for, weapons, helping, ukraine, by, dumping, weapons, into, such, a, country, is, folly, the, eu, can, not, be, heaven, for, the, entire, world, the, reality, requires, that, refugees, must, be, stopped, at, the, border, and, receive, only, temporary, shelter,   , the, number, is, simply, too, big, to, give, anyone, free, housing, free, living, free, education, free, medicare, and, a, free, pension, anybody, arguing, else, is, completely, out, of, touch, with, reality, we, are, europeans, this, is, not, racism, but, we, do, n't, support, growth, if, we, accept, many, immigrants, then, we, make, a, huge, stop, in, the, growth, of, the, migrant, countries, because, i, am, 100, sure, that, they, will, never, ever, go, back, to, their, country, i, do, not, agree, with, stripping, people, of, their, right, to, asylum, and, a, right, to, live, in, the, eu, because, they, came, illegally, i, would, instead, suggest, making, it, easier, to, migrate, legally, that, way, there, would, be, no, need, to, migrate, illegally, and, risk, your, life, while, doing, so, i, am, happy, to, see, that, the, ide, of, haling, all, immigration, from, non, european, or, non, first, world, countries, is, still, going, strong, this, message, needs, to, be, communicated, to, brussels, very, clearly, i, have, no, trouble, with, non, western, immigrants,   , i, have, trouble, with, mass, immigration,   , what, happens, is, when, they, come, in, large, numbers, they, do, not, integrate, anymore,   , they, stick, to, themselves, and, become, a, new, tribe, that, tries, to, change, their, host, country, an, eu, army, independent, from, nato, and, its, us, commanders, is, critical, to, strategic, autonomy, and, avoiding, being, dragged, into, destructive, us, wars, in, the, middle, east, like, in, the, past, if, you, want, migrants, invite, them, into, your, home, i, have, never, heard, anyone, talking, in, europe, about, world, supremacy, so, it, seems, kind, of, pointless, that, this, is, a, goal, of, eu, policy, instead, of, trying, to, stop, immigration, we, need, to, create, a, good, integration, plan, and, at, the, same, time, improve, living, conditions, in, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, world, countries, this, includes, fighting, for, climate, justice, and, decreasing, unequal, wealth, distribution, between, countries, the, eu, needs, its, own, united, army, but, not, to, fight, in, a, war, in, ukraine, against, a, country, whose, leader, is, unpredictable, and, can, use, nuclear, weapons, against, us, do, you, want, europeans, and, americans, to, get, engaged, in, a, war, with, russia, more, than, 950, million, people, would, have, to, give, up, everything, and, risk, their, livelihoods, and, lives, to, fight, in, a, war, that, is, not, ours, to, fight, and, fight, for, a, country, that, has, a, population, of, 44, million, people, what, does, legal, migration, look, like, people, can, only, ask, for, asylum, from, within, the, eu, and, must, officially, do, so, at, the, point, of, entry, this, has, caused, inhumane, circumstances, as, we, see, at, camp, moria, in, greece, what, does, legal, migration, look, like, people, can, not, ask, for, asylum, at, an, embassy, or, consulate, so, people, actually, have, to, come, to, the, eu, and, enter, the, eu, if, they, want, to, ask, for, asylum, in, the, eu, this, has, caused, inhumane, and, dangerous, circumstances, as, we, see, in, the, mediterranean, sea, the, eu, and, its, member, states, have, already, various, partnership, or, neighborhood, programs, for, non, eu, states, we, do, need, migrants, from, an, ethical, and, practical, point, of, view, europe, is, old, and, archaic, in, most, of, its, practices, innovation, is, failing, and, the, best, we, can, do, is, defend, the, status, quo, and, the, old, people, in, power,   , but, also, those, people, who, fear, migrants, thinking, they, are, all, criminals, while, 99, of, them, are, people, coming, to, work, improving, their, family, 's, life, and, paying, taxes, will, need, someone, to, pay, their, retirement, benefits/, pensions, and, to, push, their, wheelchairs, it, would, be, easier, if, the, eu, joined, nato, the, internal, rivalry, between, the, single, eu, states, would, stop, also, the, issue, of, a, legitimate, european, army, would, be, solved, however, i, am, not, sure, how, this, would, work, out, in, legal, terms, federations, have, already, joined, nato, rather, than, individual, states, but, what, would, be, the, status, of, the, eu, t, is, absurd, that, such, an, eu, policy, about, migration, is, lacking,  , the, eu, is, driving, in, the, dark, with, the, lights, switch, off, we, need, to, revisit, the, idea, of, a, defense, union, that, is, independent, of, nato, national, armies, of, eu, states, should, be, able, to, cooperate, this, includes, the, same, equipment, the, same, training, and, the, same, battle, language,  , nonsense, mass, migration, is, a, crime, against, humanity,   , endorse, this, idea, no, more, immigration, from, non, european, or, non, first, world, countries, forty, years, of, uk, membership, in, the, european, union, have, clearly, proven, that, it, is, not, a, good, idea, to, conclude, agreements, with, england, for, sure, you, are, technically, or, geographically, correct, geographically, europe, extends, to, the, ural, mountains,   , but, in, this, forum, we, initiate, a, common, thinking, on, the, future, of, europe, which, we, associate, with, the, eu, so, please, avoid, any, reference, to, arrogance, and, do, n't, corrupt, this, respectful, debate, we, certainly, need, levels, of, government, at, the, global, regional, and, local, levels, equally, we, absolutely, need, democracy, at, the, global, regional, and, local, levels, neither, the, european, nor, the, national, and, regional, parliaments, should, be, abolished, because, of, the, need, for, global, governance, for, the, planet, the, european, parliament, has, developed, avenues, for, a, common, foreign, and, defense, policy, and, should, exercise, its, role, this, way, also, there, are, prerogatives, of, a, parliament, to, guide, and, control, the, external, policies, of, the, eu, europe, should, look, at, the, european, people, first, it, is, not, fair, for, the, working, classes, to, have, to, live, within, the, ruins, of, multiculturalism, while, the, middle, class, supports, immigration, from, within, their, gated, communities, immigration, is, a, class, issue, at, the, same, time, integration, is, important, those, against, this, policy, should, be, made, to, send, their, children, to, multicultural, schools, in, order, to, help, with, integration,  , africa, has, a, lot, of, bright, young, people, with, sometimes, incredible, ideas, if, these, young, people, create, for, example, remote, learning, opportunities, for, african, students, we, should, not, only, sponsor, such, projects, but, make, exchange, possible, for, young, people, in, europe, to, create, similar, items, for, example, to, foster, mint, skills, throughout, europe, give, more, opportunities, for, young, people, from, both, sides, to, meet, exchange, and, ventilate, new, ideas, it, 's, the, same, with, citizens, of, the, usa, using, americans, to, describe, themselves, yes, technically, it, is, n't, correct, but, who, cares, marvelous, to, see, this, idea, of, halting, immigration, receive, the, most, endorsements, on, the, migration, topic, this, is, really, not, going, according, to, plan, for, the, globalists, it, is, necessary, to, make, europe, day, on, may, 9th, a, holiday, day, it, should, replace, the, respective, national, holiday, of, a, member, country, recognizing, taiwan, as, a, sovereign, state, coordinated, act, of, the, eu, usa, japan, and, australia, that, will, make, any, retaliation, from, china, much, more, difficult, the, eu, is, in, demographic, decline, at, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, europe, accounted, for, 15, of, the, world, 's, population, by, 2050, it, will, be, 5, europe, has, more, than, enough, ideological, disputes, within, its, own, borders, we, must, settle, those, first, by, falling, back, on, a, previous, more, classical, liberal, position, that, was, uncontroversial, for, most, of, our, citizens, countries, outside, the, eu, must, deal, with, their, own, problems, as, best, they, can, less, interference, from, europe, is, the, order, of, the, day, not, more, without, the, refugee, deal, the, migrants, will, return, to, invade, us, turkey, is, an, enemy, it, uses, this, deal, to, make, a, threat, stop, it, now, and, send, patrols, to, the, greek, border, or, welcome, them, complex, problems, are, faced, by, deepening, study, not, by, pretending, they, do, n't, exist, unity, needs, time, poland, and, hungary, etc, need, to, enjoy, their, freedom, for, now, they, will, eventually, see, that, working, together, with, civilized, countries, is, more, attractive, in, the, end, what, are, you, 5, and, what, do, you, mean, by, first, world, should, we, create, a, task, force, just, to, understand, what, countries, are, to, be, considered, the, first, world, is, it, the, money, the, religion, the, food, their, political, system, and, then, reevaluate, each, year, this, comment, is, plain, ignorant, i, believe, the, eu, should, expedite, the, enlargement, process, towards, the, western, balkans, to, help, them, evolve, and, facilitate, the, reconciliation, problems, as, you, say, montenegro, for, instance, is, a, peaceful, country, that, has, made, efforts, to, overcome, past, troubles, and, that, too, should, be, acknowledged, without, a, change, in, the, voting, procedure, europe, will, not, be, capable, of, doing, much, in, this, world, ukraine, will, move, forward, on, its, european, path, when, it, allows, hungarian, kids, living, on, its, territory, to, study, in, their, native, tongue, not, a, day, sooner, i, would, like, to, strongly, support, the, need, for, europe, to, gain, back, an, active, role, in, the, diplomatic, efforts, to, try, to, stabilize, the, middle, east, and, in, particular, to, find, a, just, and, fair, solution, to, the, israel, palestine, conflict, i, remember, that, the, european, union, with, the, venice, declaration, of, june, 1980, played, a, key, role, in, pushing, the, palestinians, to, the, table, of, negotiations, that, text, was, much, criticized, at, that, time, but, with, the, benefit, of, insights, it, was, right, europe, has, become, more, and, more, marginal, in, the, peace, process, and, this, has, contributed, to, a, much, aggravated, situation, where, problems, are, even, more, difficult, to, resolve, than, 40, years, ago, and, create, room, for, despair, and, violence, migration, has, totally, gotten, out, of, control, the, eu, refuses, to, see, the, magnitude, of, it, hundreds, of, millions, like, to, migrate, all, people, without, the, right, language, and, fitting, education, the, massive, numbers, of, immigrants, threaten, the, existence, of, eu, societies, through, crime, poverty, and, housing, shortage,   , refugees, can, obtain, a, visa, at, an, embassy, in, one, of, the, 54, african, countries, all, other, immigrants, must, be, returned, within, a, week, of, arrival, the, eu, should, be, a, global, actor, merge, all, foreign, affairs, departments, from, member, states, into, a, coordinated, european, network, for, international, policy, and, intelligence, abolishing, the, veto, right, in, the, current, eu, foreign, policy, voting, procedure, will, be, the, death, of, european, solidarity, it, would, turn, europe, into, a, polarized, entity, much, like, the, american, system, and, would, firmly, divide, the, european, community, on, every, issue,  , abolishing, the, veto, right, in, the, current, eu, foreign, policy, voting, procedure, will, only, serve, larger, nations, in, the, union, and, small, member, states, would, lose, all, their, power, and, slowly, turn, into, puppets, of, the, larger, nations, instead, of, equal, partners, russia, in, the, eu, no, thanks, the, eu, should, not, get, involved, in, trying, to, spread, democracy, with, threats, and, punishments, leave, that, to, the, us, we, need, the, united, states, of, europe, a, european, army, strategic, autonomy, and, acting, as, one, to, the, future, of, europe, must, belong, its, capacity, to, act, as, a, global, player,  , europe, ’s, sovereignty, and, credibility, are, at, this, price, the, burden, of, european, defense, can, not, rest, on, the, back, of, a, small, number, of, countries, and, potential, conflicts, are, increasing, africa, and, the, middle, east, have, the, highest, birthrate, in, the, world, africa, has, up, to, 7, children, per, woman, the, eu, has, 1,55,   , it, is, this, high, birthrate, that, keeps, them, poor, there, is, almost, nothing, the, eu, can, do, about, it, the, eu, is, not, responsible, for, the, entire, world, changing, the, eu, foreign, policy, voting, procedure, will, cause, serious, problems, i, find, the, current, actions, of, china, to, be, incompatible, with, the, ideology, that, the, eu, was, formed, and, still, has, to, this, day, we, can, not, have, a, relaxed, attitude, towards, a, country, that, sees, all, the, world, as, competitors, and, enemies, it, is, a, good, idea, that, france, should, coordinate, its, positions, on, the, un, security, council, with, the, eu, or, leave, its, seat, to, the, eu, entirely, this, way, foreign, policy, decision, making, within, the, eu, can, be, made, more, straightforward, there, has, to, be, better, funding, for, research, but, it, should, not, be, administered, top, down, let, researchers, decide, rather, than, politicians, do, not, stifle, research, by, bureaucracy, at, the, time, being, with, large, consortia, getting, multi, million, euro, grants, the, application, process, has, become, too, complicated, for, most, researchers, rather, invest, in, reproducible, transparent, open, research, i, strongly, agree, with, this, proposal, that, trade, and, investment, policy, should, be, reformed, especially, that, greater, attention, should, be, paid, to, environmental, aspects, the, current, situation, is, unsatisfactory, and, even, dangerous, i, opt, without, a, that, the, balkan, countries, should, be, eu, members, so, their, membership, status, helps, them, evolve, we, have, great, examples, in, romania, and, bulgaria, and, going, back, to, the, eighties, to, spain, and, portugal, those, countries, started, to, truly, develop, when, they, joined, the, eu, besides, as, you, stated, the, balkan, countries, have, made, huge, efforts, in, the, last, years, to, approach, the, eu, the, eu, member, states, need, to, lift, together, instead, of, trying, to, push, the, burdens, onto, each, other, or, external, nations, the, eu, must, ensure, that, all, products, entering, the, eu, are, grown, manufactured, and, grown, to, certain, standards, this, should, ensure, that, people, in, the, south, have, a, dignified, life, to, achieve, this, goal, might, be, helpful, to, have, european, law, state, that, all, imports, should, have, certain, labels, such, as, fair, trade, etc, economic, interests, should, never, be, at, the, expense, of, social, and, environmental, policy, it, is, of, utmost, importance, that, the, protection, of, workers, rights, and, the, rules, we, agreed, upon, with, the, paris, agreement, on, climate, change, are, at, the, heart, of, trade, and, investment, policy, as, the, eu, belongs, to, the, global, market, we, must, guarantee, decent, jobs, that, are, sustainable, as, well, as, collective, independent, representation, of, workers, in, trade, unions, helping, migrants, learn, the, language, and, culture, of, the, country, they, are, living, in, are, critical, to, successful, integration, language, and, norms, of, the, job, market, and, workplace, should, also, be, built, in, distance, is, very, important, when, trading,   , security, is, even, more, important, in, relation, to, distance,   , it, is, without, thought, to, escalate, conflict, and, it, is, not, in, the, interest, of, europe,   , russia, has, centuries, of, history, with, european, allies, it, is, in, the, interest, of, europe, to, not, leave, russia, solely, to, china, we, can, all, prosper, africa, is, the, only, continent, where, the, number, of, young, people, continues, to, increase,  , discussing, what, happened, in, the, past, between, africa, and, europe, is, useless, all, slaves, and, their, owners, died, a, long, time, ago, you, can, not, blame, the, grandchildren, if, there, are, language, problems, we, need, to, work, on, national, integration, systems, e.g., in, france, where, english, is, being, thought, in, french, language, we, have, already, english, as, a, language, of, exchange, english, is, ideal, as, it, is, spoken, internationally, as, the, language, of, commerce, travel, and, political, exchange, esperanto, is, n't, natural, languages, were, never, designed, to, be, used, for, international, communication, they, reflect, their, own, cultures, and, are, perfect, for, use, in, their, own, communities, but, the, international, language, has, different, requirements, esperanto, has, been, specifically, designed, for, this, purpose, as, an, auxiliary, language, one, that, can, bring, people, together, it, needs, serious, consideration, the, idea, that, france, should, coordinate, its, positions, on, the, un, security, council, with, the, eu, is, good, because, it, does, not, request, any, specific, un, decision, i.e, recognizing, the, eu, as, a, state, it, is, enough, that, an, internal, eu, france, agreement, determines, that, the, representative, of, france, appointed, by, agreement, between, france, and, eu, will, now, represent, the, eu, with, veto, right, and, at, the, same, time, all, other, eu, member, states, will, reinforce, this, representation, by, delegating, their, best, specialists, and, put, their, own, representation, in, vacancy, it, should, be, the, common, goal, of, eu, diplomacy, to, change, the, workings, of, the, un, as, it, is, the, security, council, is, a, relict, of, the, emerging, post, ww2, order, and, the, influence, of, the, cold, war, migration, is, part, of, being, human, and, has, always, happened, throughout, history,    , the, eu, needs, a, humane, civilized, and, legal, way, to, manage, migration, whether, it, is, for, economic, reasons, or, to, seek, international, protection, i, opt, without, a, doubt, that, the, balkan, countries, should, be, already, accepted, as, eu, members, so, that, their, membership, status, helps, them, evolve, we, have, great, examples, in, romania, and, bulgaria, and, going, back, to, the, eighties, to, spain, and, portugal, those, countries, started, to, truly, develop, when, they, joined, the, eu, besides, as, you, stated, the, balkan, countries, have, made, huge, efforts, in, the, last, years, to, approach, the, eu, if, people, make, a, revolution, for, our, system, and, values, we, must, support, them, it, is, the, ukrainian, people, who, decide, their, future, not, russia, in, order, to, support, them, we, need, a, european, army, and, a, common, foreign, policy, turkey, is, encroaching, on, eu, territory, russia, is, sending, its, army, to, the, ukrainian, border, and, what, can, we, do, nothing, because, nobody, is, taking, us, seriously, our, threats, are, empty, and, get, ignored, and, our, diplomacy, is, weak, it, 's, time, for, the, eu, to, be, recognized, as, a, strong, force, that, can, and, will, protect, its, people, and, its, interests,  , a, european, army, is, not, only, needed, to, attack, and, defend, but, to, give, weight, to, european, words, vetos, are, occurring, only, rarely, in, the, current, eu, voting, procedure, which, is, focused, on, unanimity, if, a, veto, is, happening, in, the, current, eu, voting, procedure, it, is, justified, the, intention, of, helping, a, country, with, democratization, can, easily, be, used, to, justify, violent, actions, all, refugee, camps, should, be, closed, and, illegals, moved, back, to, the, last, country, they, left, if, asylum, applications, are, filed, from, abroad, the, costs, for, eu, taxpayers, to, handle, asylum, seekers, are, reduced, if, asylum, applications, are, filed, from, abroad, the, humanitarian, crisis, in, the, mediterranean, sea, is, ended, if, asylum, applications, are, filed, from, abroad, the, security, risks, for, asylum, seekers, are, greatly, reduced, we, need, to, accept, more, immigrants, to, combat, the, aging, of, the, european, population, immigrants, do, also, grow, old, but, before, then, they, generally, have, children,   , do, you, have, some, reservations, about, the, eu, go, and, protest, your, own, government, 's, decisions, because, it, 's, the, member, states, that, decide, what, the, eu, can, do, and, what, it, ca, n't, unfortunately, the, eu, does, not, have, an, actual, army, not, because, of, bureaucrats, but, because, our, member, states, think, they, are, better, alone, than, united, the, eu, should, be, able, to, contribute, to, a, relaunch, of, global, multilateralism, through, a, profound, reform, based, on, democracy, and, peace, solidarity, and, respect, for, human, social, and, environmental, rights, expansion, by, many, dissimilar, members, and, in, particular, the, implementation, of, the, euro, has, made, the, eu, unmanageable,   , the, euro, is, too, strong, for, the, less, competitive, members, and, is, therefore, unsustainable,  , without, change, the, eu, will, be, following, the, route, of, the, ussr, and, other, communist, countries, who, after, 70, years, of, trying, to, build, a, social, paradise, ended, in, poverty, and, suppression, if, young, europeans, are, living, abroad, they, will, feel, racism, on, their, own, in, the, country, they, are, living, in, no, duck, would, like, to, live, with, eagles, or, sparrows,   , that, 's, nature, not, wishful, thinking, each, country, should, keep, its, power, which, is, ensured, through, the, current, unanimous, voting, process, in, the, european, union, paying, taxes, is, not, enough, need, if, you, want, to, become, a, citizen, with, full, rights, you, need, t, fully, embrace, the, country, you, live, in, we, need, one, single, president, of, the, commission, that, will, chair, the, commission, and, the, council, i, wonder, though, how, the, president, of, the, eu, parliament, would, be, involved, in, this, structure, there, are, memberstaates, in, the, european, union, that, do, not, want, any, asylum, seekers, in, their, country, for, example, denmark, sends, back, all, syrens, and, other, arabians, there, is, a, huge, void, to, fill, regarding, the, eu, wide, news, media, there, are, media, that, on, purpose, refuse, to, cover, the, eu, and, our, common, european, problems, and, successes,  , we, have, a, deficit, in, democracy, in, the, eu, because, of, the, lack, of, coverage, of, european, affairs, in, our, media, it, 's, also, the, reason, why, people, do, n't, know, much, about, the, eu, and, do, n't, understand, how, it, benefits, us, all, the, unanimous, vote, is, the, cause, of, european, stagnation, foreign, and, security, policy, requires, speed, unanimity, should, be, replaced, with, a, qualified, majority, the, eu, should, acknowledge, the, fact, that, increasing, birth, rates, in, europe, and, supporting, european, families, to, have, more, children, is, the, most, appropriate, long, term, solution, for, increasing, the, birthrate, and, supporting, young, families, hungary, should, be, an, example, we, should, not, rely, on, migration, for, this, we, can, have, a, strong, federal, europe, that, will, protect, the, rights, of, individuals, and, communities, that, will, have, the, power, to, tackle, the, climate, emergency, and, stand, up, to, other, superpowers, let, 's, go, forward, and, make, the, eu, the, shared, home, that, we, all, want, to, live, in, that, can, lead, the, world, in, dealing, with, the, problems, we, face, on, our, planet,  , only, if, europe, has, an, energy, partnership, with, africa, europe, will, be, able, to, produce, enough, clean, energy, the, eu, should, develop, fair, cooperation, with, the, african, union, and, also, offer, africa, an, alternative, to, the, geopolitical, attempts, of, other, powers, to, establish, themselves, as, global, hegemons, i, wholeheartedly, agree, securing, our, neighbors, and, allies, has, to, be, a, priority, the, only, thing, that, causes, me, some, dismay, is, turkey, being, a, part, of, nato, it, was, a, good, idea, in, 1951, but, clearly, turkey, must, be, out, off, the, map, now, the, european, flag, should, be, systematically, displayed, in, addition, to, the, national, flag, on, any, facade, of, an, embassy, or, consulate, of, a, european, country, this, would, enhance, the, image, of, the, european, union, in, addition, to, synergies, like, the, pooling, of, support, services, this, approach, could, accompany, the, construction, of, common, structures, and, policies, in, the, field, of, foreign, affairs, we, need, an, investment, policy, that, creates, decent, jobs, and, fosters, labor, rights, and, especially, trade, unions, around, the, globe, there, can, not, be, a, sustainable, world, without, collective, representation, of, workers, employees, by, free, trade, unions, the, eu, should, continue, its, enlargement, to, the, western, balkans, to, further, its, own, interests, and, to, bring, stability, and, prosperity, to, the, region, serbia, should, have, joined, long, ago, trade, should, always, include, the, respect, and, the, protection, of, fundamental, and, human, rights, including, workers, and, trade, union, rights, the, emphasis, on, negative, stereotypes, towards, migrants, comes, mostly, from, people, who, do, n't, know, africans, or, other, migrants, or, refugees, migrants, have, an, enormous, amount, to, offer, in, energy, new, ideas, and, cultures, why, this, emphasis, on, imaginary, takeovers, france, should, offer, its, seat, on, the, un, security, council, so, european, interests, are, represented, we, need, a, real, eu, commitment, to, policy, coherence, for, peace, on, one, hand, the, eu, is, promoting, peace, dignity, and, on, the, other, hand, there, are, investments, in, hard, security, tools, defense, industry, programs, democracy, and, civilization, are, the, essences, of, europe, and, the, eu, must, uphold, those, values, for, me, the, word, civilization, is, also, to, be, civil, which, in, some, way, is, the, opposite, of, being, militarized,   , the, eu, should, not, be, a, superpower,   , nuclear, detergence, should, be, enough,   , there, is, enough, environmental, task, to, handle, and, europe, have, had, its, wars, but, to, streamline, our, powers, and, therefore, try, to, save, huge, amounts, of, money, is, a, no, brainer, giving, small, countries, veto, rights, is, a, recipe, for, disaster, that, will, keep, the, european, union, separated, and, weak, instead, of, united, and, reliable, in, policy, making, according, to, mrs, ., ngozi, okonjat, african, countries, follow, the, example, of, the, asian, tigers, i, do, n't, really, agree, with, that, europe, is, not, china, and, is, not, the, usa, we, do, n't, need, a, strong, army, because, europeans, do, n't, plan, to, make, war, our, strength, is, to, find, common, ground, and, bring, peace, to, the, world, with, diplomacy, and, intelligence, norway, and, iceland, can, provide, their, external, point, of, view, toward, eu, policy, at, the, conference, but, why, only, norway, and, iceland, why, not, switzerland, why, not, the, recognized, candidates,    , and, maybe, even, uk, i, ', m, sure, there, are, many, lessons, to, learn, from, their, experience, in, the, eu, and, from, the, brexit, both, a, reform, of, eu, trade, and, investment, policy, and, a, relaunch, of, global, multilateralism, are, overdue, migrants, have, a, complete, lack, of, critical, thinking,  , migrants, willingly, risk, their, lives, migrants, depend, on, other, countries, social, systems, migrants, sell, drugs, the, protection, of, fundamental, and, human, rights, decent, work, and, the, high, quality, of, public, services, for, all, must, be, an, integral, part, of, trade, and, investment, policy, reform, the, european, union, is, doing, amazingly, well, in, relation, to, the, enormous, bad, publicity, it, is, receiving, from, all, sides, and, as, if, that, were, not, enough, in, itself, very, large, countries, from, around, the, world, are, doing, constantly, dividing, work, between, member, states, as, all, successes, start, in, your, head, perhaps, some, attention, should, be, allocated, to, the, media, the, eu, has, a, clear, chance, to, become, one, of, the, major, poles, of, this, multipolar, world, order, it, 's, not, a, good, idea, to, pursue, further, enlargement, the, greater, the, territory, the, harder, it, is, to, control, and, keep, problems, from, appearing, every, large, empire, in, history, fell, because, it, grew, to, such, size, that, it, could, n't, be, properly, managed, and, ruled, over, examples, from, history, do, n't, become, suddenly, invalid, because, we, 're, living, in, the, 21st, century, the, stated, proposal, for, a, new, eu, foreign, policy, is, very, well, thought, through, ukraine, is, a, part, of, europe, geographically, diplomatically, and, culturally, if, ukraine, wants, to, join, the, eu, we, should, grant, our, brothers, and, sisters, full, membership, in, our, union, mass, migration, is, hybrid, warfare, directed, against, our, stability, state, actors, such, as, morocco, belarus, and, turkey, have, already, taken, advantage, of, mass, migration, mass, migration, is, hybrid, warfare, directed, against, our, stability, ngos, organize, finance, and, promote, migration, to, get, advantages, the, present, international, economic, system, and, trade, institutions, are, too, much, a, product, of, the, not, so, glorious, colonial, past, we, should, put, more, democracy, more, rights, for, people, and, more, equality, into, the, international, economic, order,  , sustainable, development, and, climate, change, mitigation, in, eu, trade, deals, should, be, examples, of, best, practices, of, eu, policy, large, bureaucratic, organizations, such, as, the, eu, are, the, product, of, the, industrial, age, and, unfortunately, without, significant, reforms, they, will, not, survive, the, digital, age, the, digital, age, leads, to, decentralization, and, cost, efficiency, such, as, a, decentralized, flow, of, information, e.g., internet, and, money, e.g., bitcoin, without, the, need, for, centralized, control, which, is, very, expensive, to, maintain, i.e., eu, the, eu, needs, to, both, promote, and, uphold, the, highest, social, and, environmental, standards, in, its, internal, as, well, as, external, policies, human, rights, and, collective, agreements, must, never, be, seen, as, barriers, to, trade, europe, should, represent, its, own, interests, the, integration, of, eastern, europe, should, be, a, priority, most, of, them, are, pretty, small, countries, so, they, would, not, constitute, an, economic, burden, if, that, is, what, all, is, about,   , should, we, wait, for, those, countries, to, be, prepared, politically, and, economically, or, just, the, other, way, around, we, should, integrate, them, already, so, that, eu, membership, boosts, their, development, they, are, as, much, europeans, as, we, are,  , pooling, sharing, increases, the, size, availability, the, diversity, of, specific, military, resources, but, decreases, their, global, cost, at, the, same, time, pooling, sharing, integrates, military, capabilities, at, the, european, level, and, creates, a, european, culture, in, the, military, sector, i, am, all, for, the, creation, of, a, european, army, but, for, that, the, question, of, the, command, of, this, army, must, also, be, resolved, and, this, is, where, the, idea, of, a, european, security, council, is, very, interesting, and, deserves, to, be, pushed, i, am, in, favor, of, a, possible, army, but, i, would, like, to, see, it, combined, with, social, services, and, reconstruction, so, ngos, and, development, cooperation, must, be, involved, an, army, that, can, fight, must, also, be, able, to, build, we, therefore, also, need, a, civilian, army, in, europe, i, would, also, like, an, army, consisting, of, civilians, in, uniform, in, the, same, way, as, the, german, army, please, also, take, into, account, the, right, to, refuse, orders, due, to, conscientious, objection, also, as, in, the, german, army, absolutely, right, europe, needs, an, army, for, continental, defense, conscription, must, be, introduced, at, the, european, level, the, army, must, have, the, most, modern, weapons, to, deter, russia, turkey, and, china, in, principle, i, would, be, in, favor, of, a, european, army, but, i, would, tie, it, to, a, reform, of, european, decision, making, majority, or, 2/3, majority, an, army, is, worth, nothing, if, the, members, can, not, agree, or, if, a, single, country, uses, it, as, a, means, of, pressure, to, push, through, its, own, interests, i, agree, with, your, idea, but, it, is, a, long, and, arduous, way, to, reach, the, goal, what, 's, the, point, of, building, a, skyscraper, without, a, foundation, what, i, mean, by, that, first, the, eu, needs, a, unified, foreign, policy, and, only, then, a, common, and, united, army, a, european, army, is, not, a, controversial, idea, but, a, question, of, what, integration, of, the, armed, forces, of, the, member, states, means, and, what, an, army, is, in, general, eu, action, on, security, and, defense, must, extend, to, vigilance, openness, and, transparency, in, economic, financial, fiscal, and, social, infrastructures, a, european, or, joint, ideally, worldwide, army, is, not, a, hierarchy, but, an, idea, of, common, values, in, the, sense, of, human, rights, and, strategic, and, coordinated, action, as, well, as, socio, economic, prosperity, for, all, without, environmental, pollution, but, ordinances, decrees, etc, are, a, kind, of, silent, mail, and, can, falsify, the, legal, goals, and, values, as, can, reports, and, statistics, on, the, one, hand, we, have, russia, killing, countless, ukrainians, and, committing, sabotage, in, britain, and, the, czech, republic, and, on, the, other, hand, we, have, reluctant, united, states, that, is, switching, between, isolationist, and, interventionist, policies, every, 4, 8, years,    , i, stand, convinced, that, in, order, for, the, european, union, to, move, forward, it, must, begin, to, introduce, measures, for, the, security, of, both, the, current, member, states, as, well, as, the, future, member, states, that, are, endangered, due, to, foreign, aggression, and, bring, the, responsibility, of, continental, safety, firmly, in, our, own, hands, if, europe, is, to, find, the, peace, it, must, have, the, means, to, create, peace, by, being, able, to, protect, itself, against, hostile, foreign, influences, the, subsidies, were, originally, intended, to, ensure, the, security, of, supply, for, the, european, population, but, when, you, export, subsidized, food, it, 's, at, the, expense, of, european, taxpayers, export, yes, but, then, no, more, subsidies, for, these, products, these, products, come, mainly, from, large, enterprises, which, do, not, necessarily, focus, on, environmental, protection, subsidies, often, make, farmers, in, recipient, countries, uncompetitive, hampering, local, production, and, increasing, migratory, pressure, the, eu, can, not, endlessly, lean, on, america, or, nato, america, has, proven, to, be, fickle, and, nato, has, its, own, problems, such, as, turkey, which, is, outside, the, eu, and, has, threatened, greece, the, eu,
